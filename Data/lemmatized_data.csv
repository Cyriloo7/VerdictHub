REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The judge ’s approach was correct. No unfa irness had arisen  in consequence of th e irregularities which 
occurred, and there  was no obstacle to the making  of the confiscation order.  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 S.14 allows confiscation proceedings to be postponed until after sentence, for up to two years from 
conviction. Post ponement may be applied for by the parties or may be granted by the court of its own 
motion. If there is a defect in procedure relating to postponement, as there was here, s.14(11) states 
that this alone is not sufficient to require a confiscation order ma de in the defective proceedings to be 
quashed. However, s.14(12) dis -applies s.14(11) where , before the making of a confiscation order , an 
order has been made which s.15(2) says should not precede a confiscation order. Therefore, where 
forfeiture and depri vation orders have been made prior to confiscation proceedings, the rule under 
s.14(11) – that the court is not prevented from making confiscation order s solely because  there was a 
defect in the procedure relating to postponement  – does not apply  [9-14]. The issue in this case was 
whether the dis-application of the s.14(11) bar had the consequence that a confiscation order made 
with a defect in postponement procedure must always be quashed  [18].  
 
Preceding the insertion of ss.14(11) and (12), there was som e uncertainty as to the legal consequences 
of procedural errors. This was clarified in R v Soneji  [2005] UKHL 49 and R v Knights  [2005] UKHL 50 , 
where the House of Lords held that the dominant purpose of POCA was to make confiscation the 
duty of the court.  It would defeat the purpose of the confiscation legislation if orders were treated as 
bad simply because there had been a failure to comply with procedural provisions laid down for 
postponement. The correct approach was to question whether the dut y to mak e a confiscation order 
was removed by procedural errors which caused  injustice or unfairness to the defendant. S.14(11) was 
subsequently introduced with the effect of clarifying on a statutory footing that a procedural error in 
postponement  does not  on its  own invalidate the confiscation procedure [15-17]. 
 
The trial judge’s interpretation of the operation of ss.14(11) and (12) was correct . The fact that the bar 
to quashing a confiscation order in certain circumstances is dis -applied does not give rise to a  
requirement to quash in those circumstances. Where s.14(11) applies, no procedural defect relating to 
postponement can on its own justify quashing. Where s.14(11) does not apply , and there ha s been a 
procedural defect relating  to postponement, an order ma y be quashed, or it may not be. Applying the 
principles in Soneji and Knights , the position is that a procedural defect (not limited to postponement) 
will have the effect of making it wrong to make a confiscation order if unfairness to the defendant 
would ensue. If the order would give rise to no unfairness, or to none that cannot be cured, there can 
be no obstacle to making the order [19-30]. 
 
The Court of Appeal’s interpretation of  s.14(12) as prescribing that an order will be invalidated for a 
procedural  error was wrong. This was to approach s.14(11) as if it restored the position to the pre -
Soneji  case law  which regarded  procedural errors as going to the court’s jurisdiction to make a 
confiscation order. The trial judge was correct to continue to follow the Soneji and Knights approach , 
whose analysis still holds good  [22].  
 
That u nfairness has resulted from a procedural error may be inferred in the event of a very long period 
of inactivity. If the  statutory permitted two -year postponement period is excee ded without there being 
exceptional circumstances, it is likel y that unfairness will ensue . The present case is one where it has 
been accepted that the Respondent cannot point to unfairness, injury or injustice resulting from the 
making of the order after the prescribed timetable. The order was eventually made within the 
permitted period of two years . As there is no unfairness in this case, the question of curable unfairness 
does not arise. If it were to arise, a potential unfairness might be cured for exam ple by adjusting a 
confiscation order, or by quashing a forfeiture order. Each ca se must depend on its own facts [31-4].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Appeal  
 
The powers of the review committee following the original  committee’s direction for a registrant’s 
suspension  are set out in article 54(3)(a) of the 2010 Order. That article does not indicate how the 
powers should be exercised,  and only limited assistance may be derived from the  General 
Pharmaceutical Council (Fitness to Practise and Disqualification etc) Rules 2 010. Rule 34(4) requires  
the representative of the council to inform the review committee of the background to the case and 
sanction previously imposed and to direct its attention to any relevant evidence. Rule 34(4) and (5) 
permit both parties to adduce e vidence “in relation to the person concern’s fitness to practice”. Rule 
34(6) provides that, following a direction for suspension, the review committee “must receive further 
evidence” although the subject of it is not identified. It certainly seems that th e reference to the 
registrant’s fitness to practise relates to his fitness at the time of the review hearing [24].  
 
Greater assistance is collected from the Indicative Sanctions Guidance which makes clear that the 
focus of the review is upon the current f itness of the registrant to resume practice, judged in the light 
of what he has, or has not, achieved since the date of suspension. The review committee asks: does his 
fitness to practise remain impaired [27]. The r ecent work of the three UK Law Comm ission s in this 
area proposes that the review committee should address changes relevant to impairment which have – 
or have not – occurred since the date of the original  committee’s direction [28].  It is also noteworthy 
that in the fifth report of the Shipman  Inquiry, the Chairman stated that review hearings “should focus 
the doctor’s mind on the need to undertake any necessary remediation ” [29]. 
 
The Extra Division’s conception is alien to the generally accepted conception of a review as a vehicle 
for monitoring  the steps taken by the registrant towards securing professional rehabilitation [31]. Taylor 
v General Medical Council  [1990] 2 AC 539, not cited to the Extra Division, expressly holds that the 
conception favoured by the Extra Division is misplaced [32]. In Taylor  the court held that “it can never 
be a proper ground for the exercise of the power to extend the period of suspension that the period 
originally directed was insufficient to reflect the gravity of the original offence” [33]. The Extra 
Division was  too ingenious. There was no middle way. It was wrong to remit the case to the 
committee on that basis [35]. 
 
The Cross -Appeal   
 
The original  committee itself acknowledged that its direction for removal might appear harsh. Serious 
though Mr Khan’s miscondu ct certainly was, t he sanction appropriate to the disrepute into which Mr 
Khan’s conduct had brought, or was likely to bring, the profession of pharmacy was suspension of his 
registration, which, at the time of the committee’s determination, should no doub t have been for a 
period of a year [40]. 
 
A direction for suspension should be substituted in place of the original  committee’s direction for 
removal from the register. In light of Mr Khan’s interim suspension since the date of the original  
committee’s dir ection, the period of his suspension should be four months and a review committee 
should conduct a review prior to the expiry of this period [41].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The public are entitled to the legislative scheme being  underpinned by a coherent view of the meaning 
of the rules and regulations. The  court agrees with the Court of Appeal as to the need for 
rationalisation and simplification [30].   
 
The approach to the present appeals must be ba sed on the legislation as it stands, since there has been 
no challenge to the legality or rationality of the rules and regulations. Ordinary principles of statutory 
interpretation are to be used, starting from the natural meaning of the words in their cont ext. On this 
basis, the Court of Appeal in respect of Mr Iqbal and Mr Mirza reached the correct conclusion. There 
is no ambiguity in the words of regulation 37 of the 2011 Regulations: if an application is not 
accompanied by the specified fee it “is not va lidly made”. An application not validly made can have no 
substantive effect [33]. It does not matter that section 3C was enacted before the provisions of the 
2006 Act or the regulations made under it , because the powers given by Parliament in the later Act  
were made within the same legislative framework as the 2002 Act. This does not equate with 
permitting the executive to alter the interpretation of primary legislation [34]. 
 
The Court of Appeal was also right in rejecting Mr Iqbal’s ground of appeal based  on alleged 
unfairness. The comments of the Upper Tribunal in Basnet do not lay down a universal rule and 
although it is unfortunate that he was caught out by a change in fees, there was no failure by the 
Secretary of State to publicise that change. The pr oblem only arose because the application had been 
made very close to the expiry of leave [35]. 
 
In the case of Ms Ehsan  the situation is slightly different. While the obligation to pay fees arises at the 
time of the application, the requirement to apply fo r biometric information only arises at a later stage. 
Thus, while an application without the fee will be invalid from the outset, it is difficult to see why a 
failure at the biometric information stage should retrospectively invalidate an application from the 
outset, nullifying any section 3C extension to her leave to remain.  There is no reason to read section 7 
of the 2007 Act as having retrospective effect. Rather, the natural reading is to give power to invalidate 
the application from the time of the dec ision. However this reading would not help Ms Ehsan because 
even if her leave continued until the date of the Secretary of State’s decision on 26 March 2012, it 
would not assist her in respect of her new application made on 3 April 2012  [36-7].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Commencement Order setting out transitional provisions for the introduction of LASPO was 
lawful . It did not breach Article 7 ECHR,  it was legitimate ly made  and was rational, and if it was 
discriminatory (which was doubtful) then it was justifiably so .  
 
With the exception of a mandatory life sentence for murder, English criminal sentencing is  a matter 
for the judge. Statute prescribe s the statutory maximum, within which the judge may sentence, taking 
into account the relevant guidelines. The judge must sentence according to the law and practice 
prevailing at the time of sentence, regardless of when the offence was committed . Thus if t he 
maximum sentence has been reduced by statute since the offence was committed, the court will 
sentence within that now current maximum , or if sentencing practice has moved downward, the court 
should sentence in line with that.  
 
Article 7 ECHR requires that there be no punishment without law . This  has always said, explicitly, that 
no sentence may be imposed which exceeds that to which the defendant was exposed at the time of 
committing the offence (“lex gravior”).  Since the statutory maximum for the Appel lant’s offences was 
the same at the time of offence and sentence, the principle of lex gravior is not offended.  The principle 
of “lex mitior” , in contrast,  is that if provision is made by law for a lighter penalty, subsequent to the 
commission of the offen ce, the offender shall benefit from that lighter penalty.  The Strasbourg court 
has held in 2010 in Scoppola v Italy (No 2)  (2010) 51 EHRR 12 that Article 7 also requires compliance 
with this principle.  There are some difficulties in establishing the exact  meaning which the court gave 
to lex mitior, but it is not necessary to resolve them because it is clear that the English practice of 
sentencing according to current law and practice, subject to the statutory maximum obtaining at the 
time of the offenc e (if lower) complies with it. The Strasbourg court cannot have meant that it is 
necessary to examine all intervening rules or practices between the offence and the sentencing process, 
and to sentence according to whichever is the most favourable.  That would not accord with good 
reason or with the rationale of lex mitior, or with the English practice.  Lex mitior is in any event of no 
assistance to Docherty because it does not involve anticipating the commencement of a new and more 
favourable sentencing scheme  [42-49]. 
 
The reading of the provisions of the Commencement Order, together with the provisions of LASPO 
is clear: IPP and EPP disappear from the sentencing armoury on 3 December 2012, except for anyone 
already convicted but not yet sentenced, as in the c ase of the Appellant. There was no breach of 
Article 7 ECHR. In any event, the Appellant’s argument that he should benefit from the accelerated 
removal of IPP from the old scheme but claim the preservation of another pa rt of it (EPP) is 
inconsistent [58].  
 
Further, there was nothing contrary to LASPO’s statutory purpose in the Commencement Order’s 
transitional provisions. s.151 of LASPO enables such an order to be made, and that it may make 
transitional provisions. The phased commencement of the new senten cing scheme was both legitimate 
and rational.  The Appellant’s discrimination argument also fails. It is doubtful whether being subjected 
to a different sentencing regime to another prisoner, due to a different date of conviction, could 
amount to a sufficie nt status to bring it within the anti -discrimination provision of Article 14 ECHR. 
Even if it could, the differential treatment is clearly justified by the need for all sentencing changes to 
start somewhere  [61-63].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In a murder trial where diminished responsibility is an issue, the judge is not ordinarily required to 
direct the jury beyond the terms of the statute, and should not attempt to define the meaning of 
“substantially”. However, if there is a risk that the jury will misunderstand the meaning of substantial, 
then a direction is required. Whether this risk arises is a matter for the judge. This may be the case 
where the jury has been introduced to the question of whether any impairm ent beyond the trivial will 
suffice, or has been introduced to the concept of a spectrum between greater than trivial and total. The 
judge must direct that while an impairment must be more than merely trivial to be substantial, it is not 
the case that any impairment that is  more than trivial will suffice  [43]. 
 
Lord Hughes carrie s out a comprehensive review of the treatment of the expression “substantial 
impairment” in the context of the diminished responsibility defence  in cases from both England and 
Scotl and (from whose common law the English defence was derived). This included the old 
formulation of the defence in the Homicide Act 1957 before it had been amended by the Coroners 
and Justice Act 2009. In the earlier formulation the phrase “substantially imp aired” applied to the 
global concept of mental responsibility, rather than to the ability to do one or more specified things , as 
it now does  [6]. There is no indication that Parliament wished the same expression to carry a different 
meaning in the new the formulation of diminished responsibility, or therefore that the authorities on 
the old formulation should not apply to the new law [30-35]. 
 
In ordinary usage, “substantial” is capable of meaning either (1) “present rather than illusory or 
fanciful, thus h aving some substance”, or (2) “important or weighty”. Either sense can be used in law 
making, and the word may take its meaning from its context. The review of the authorities clearly 
shows that in the context of diminished responsibility the expression “s ubstantially” has always been 
held to be used in the second of the two possible meanings [27].  This meaning of the expression also 
accords with principle – there must be a weighty reason for a reduction from murder to the lesser 
offence of manslaughter, an d not merely a reason which just passes the trivial [36]. 
 
In the authorities reviewed, t he expression “ substantially impaired ” has been consistently treated as a 
question of degree, and one that should be left to the jury . The cases repeated and re -emphas ised, but 
did not attempt to re -define the statutory expression. However, they did proceed on the assumption 
that “substantially” in this context meant impairment which was of some importance, or a serious 
degree of impairment. It was not contemplated in a ny of the cases considered that it was sufficient that 
the impairment merely passed triviali ty [9-26]. 
 
Where triviality was mentioned, as in R v Lloyd  [1967] 1 QB 175, it was in the context of a direction to 
the jury that “substantial impairment” fell bet ween two extremities: more than merely trivial, but less 
than total. It is clear  from the decision in that and other appeals that there was no intention to direct 
that any impairment beyond the trivial sufficed, or that the reference to the extremities of possible 
impairment should provide a definition of substantial impairment. Beyond the merely trivial, what 
amounted to a substantial impairment was a matter of degree for the jury.  
 
There i s usually no need for the jury to be directed on the meaning of or dinary words: any atte mpt to 
find synonyms or re -define such words complicates  the jury’s task and leads to further debate. There 
will be many cases where the need for elucidation does not arise, for example where the  suggested 
impairment, if it existed, i s clearly substantial . If the need does arise, the judge may offer he lp on what 
the expression means , but must avoid substituting a single synonym, and it is usually better to avoid 
the “spectrum” referred to  in R v Lloyd  [37-42].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
The Immigration R ules (‘the Rules’) were a relevant and important consideration which the Upper 
Tribunal ought to have taken into account  when  assessing the proportionality o f the interference with 
the appellant’s  article 8 rights . It should also have taken into account that his relationship with his 
partner was formed at a time when his immigration status was such that the persistence of family life 
within the UK was uncertai n [60]. 
The European Court of Human Rights  has provided guidance to the factors which should be taken 
into account  in the  balancing exercise  (for example in Boultif v Switzerland  (2001) 33 EHRR 50 , Maslov v 
Austria  [2009 ] INLR 47 , Jeunesse v Netherlands  (2014) 60 EHRR 17 ). These factors involve wide -ranging 
consideration of the appellant’s circumstances including the nature of his private and family life in the 
UK, his links to the destination country, and the likelihood of him re -offending [26-33]. The we ight to 
be attached to each factor in the balancing exercise falls within the margin of appreciation of the 
national authorities [35].  
The Rules  set out the Secretary of State’s  assessment of the weight generally to be afforded to some of 
these factors. In particular, the Rules prescribe a presumption that the deportation of foreign criminals 
is in the public interest, except where specified factors are present which the Rules accept outweigh 
that interest . Outside of those specified factors  (for example in every case where a custodial sentence 
of 4 years of more has been imposed , as here) , the Rules state that exceptional circumstances – that is, 
compelling reasons – are required to outweigh the  public interest in deportation . The Rules are not 
law, but d o have a statutory basis and require the approval of Parliament. It is within the margin of 
appreciation to adopt rules reflecting the assessment of the general public interest made by the 
Secretary of State and endorsed by Parliament.  [15-23, 36-39]. 
As an appellate body, the Upper Tribunal’s decision making pr ocess is not governed by the R ules, but 
should nevertheless involve their consideration. The Upper Tribunal must make its own assessment of 
the proportionality of deportation , on the basis of its ow n consideration  of the factors relevant to the 
particular case,  and application of the relevant law.  But in doing so, it must not disregard the decision 
under appeal . Where the Secretary of State has adopted a policy in relation to the assessment of 
propor tionality, set out in the Rules and endorsed by Parliament, the Upper Tribunal should give 
considerable weight to that policy. In this case that policy was that a  custodial sentence of four years or 
more represents such a serious level of offending that th e public interest in the offender’s deportation 
almost always outweighs countervailing considera tions of private or family life [39-50, 60 -64]. 
Lord Wilson  adds that public concern (as reflected in the Rules endorsed by Parliament) can assist  a 
court’s ob jective analysis of where the public interest lies  [65-81]. Lord Thomas  emphasises the 
importance of clear reasoning at first instance through a structured ‘balance sheet’ approach [82-84]. 
In a dissenting judgment, Lord Kerr would have allow ed the appeal and upheld the decision of the 
Upper Tribunal. He concluded that the application of the Rules, and their prescription of the weight to 
be given to the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals, were not compatible with the 
balancing exercise that had to be undertaken in considering the relevant factors arising under article 8 
in a particular case . It had been sufficient for the Upper Tribunal to take into account thos e relevant 
factors. Undue or unique reliance on the Rules, at the expense of a comprehensive survey of the 
pertinent article 8 factors was not appropriate.

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Where a decision is taken about the deportation of a foreign criminal who has children residing in the 
United Kingdom , separate consideration of their best interests is required, especially if they do not 
converge with those of the parent to be deported  and particularly in the case of a child with dual ethnic 
background.  The child’s interests must rank as a primary consideration  [40]. 
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The question of whether sufficient considera tion of the article 8 issues which arise in a particular case 
can take place t hrough the application of the immigration rules has been thoroughly discussed in the 
associated case of Ali v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC  60. But the issue in this 
case is si mply whether the Secretary of State was in fact  provide d with sufficient material on which to 
make a proper judgment on  the article 8 rights  of the appellant and his children [ 41].   
 
All the evidence on this issue leads unmistakeably to the conclusion that the appellant did not enjoy 
any relationship with eit her of his children and they led lives which were wholly untouched by the 
circumstance that he was their father. While the possibility of such a relationship developing was a 
factor to be considered, in this case the material available to the Secretary of State could admit of no 
conclusion other than it was unlikely in the extreme. The lately produced information that the mother 
of his son might re -consider contact between them partakes of a last throw of a desperate dice  [42].  
The Secretary of State was t herefore not obliged to make yet further inquiries in relation to the 
appellant and his children beyond those which had already taken place  [44].   
 
Lady Hale adds that c hildren must be recognised as ri ghts-holders on their own account  and not just as 
adjuncts to other people’s rights  [47]. But that does not mean that their rights are inevitably a passport 
to another person’s rights. The problem in this case is that it is the appellant who is treating the 
children as a passport to his own rights, rather tha n as rights -holders in their own right.  His daughter 
is now 19 and has had no contact with him since she was five  [48]. Without a very good reason to the 
contrary, the Secretary of State is entitled to treat the orders of the family courts as reflecting w hat is 
indeed in the best interests of the children concerned. The idea that the Secretary of State should make 
her own investigation of matters which have already been investigated by the family courts is not only 
unrealistic, but would also create uncert ainty and anxiety for the children. Of course it is good for 
children, especially children of mixed ethnicity, to have a relationship with both of t heir parents. But it 
also good for them to have peace and stability. The daughter  is not prevented from esta blishing a 
relations hip with her father by him living  in Tunisia  [49]. There  was no credible evidence that the 
appellant had sought contact with his son and nothing to suggest that the appellant has been making a 
meaningful contribution to his life. He too requires peace and stability and can establish a relationship 
with his father in future should he wish to do so  [50]. 
 
There is nothing at all to suggest that the best interests of these children require  that their father 
should remain in the United Kingd om. Of course there will be cases where fuller inquiries are 
warranted or where the best interests of children do outweigh the public interest in deportation or 
removal, but this is emphatically not one of them  [51].

In respect of the MA claimants ’ discrimination claims , the Supreme Court unanimously allows the 
appeal of Mrs Carmichae l and dismisses the other claimants’ appeals. The MA claimants’ appeals under 
the Equality Act are unanimously dismissed. The Secretary of State’s appeal in respect of the  
Rutherford  family  is unanimously dismissed.  The Secretary of State’s appeal in respe ct of A is  allowed , 
and A’s cross appeal is dismissed,  by a majority of 5 to 2. Lord Toulson gives the lead judgment. Lady 
Hale gives a dissenting judgment in relation to A in respect of both the Secretary of State’s appeal and 
A’s cross -appeal,  with which  Lord Carnwath  agrees.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The normal test in cases involving questions of economic and social policy is whether the 
discrimination i s “manifestly without reasonable foundation” . The question of h ow to deal with the impact of 
Reg B1 3 on individuals with  disabilities is a clear example of a question  of economic and social policy; 
the housing benefit cap scheme is integral to the structure of the welfare benefit scheme. The Court of 
Appeal was therefore correct  to apply this test  [28-38].  
 
In respect of the application of the test, the Court of Appeal was correct that the Secretary of State’s 
decision to structure the housing benefit cap scheme as he did was reasonable [40-41]. However, some 
people with disabilities have a transparent medical need for an additional bedroom . Reg B13 recognises 
this and entitles claimants to  an additional bedroom  in the case of children  (but not adults)  who cannot 
share a bedroom because of their disabilities or adults  (but not children)  in need of an ove rnight carer  
[42]. Mrs Carmichael, is an adult who cannot share a room with her husband due to her disabilities . 
The Rutherfords require  a regular overnight carer for their grandson with severe disabilities . There 
appears to be no reason to distinguish  between adult partners  who cannot share a bedroom because of 
disability and children who cannot do so because of disability ; or between adults and children in need 
of an overnight carer.  The decisions in relation  to Mrs Carmichael and the Rutherfords  were therefore 
manifestly without reason [46-49].  
 
In relation  to the other MA claimants, their need for an additional bedroom is not connected , or not 
directly connected,  to their/their family member’ s disability. Therefore, whilst there may be good 
reasons for them to receive state benefits to cover the full rent, it is not unreasonable for their claims 
to be considered on an individual basis under the DHP scheme [51-54]. 
 
A, has a strong case for staying in her current house; it has been adap ted under the sanct uary scheme 
and she feels safe where she is  [58]. However, there is no automatic correlation between being in a 
sanctuary scheme and requiring an extra bedroom: the reason that A currently has an additional 
bedroom  is that no two bedroom properties  were av ailable when she moved . The Court has 
considerable sy mpathy for A as she has strong social and personal reasons for staying , however, these 
are unrelated to the property size . The fact that people may have strong reasons unrelated to the 
number of bedrooms , for wanting to stay in their property is taken account of through the DHPs. It 
therefore does not follow that A  has a valid claim for unlawful sex discrimination  [59-64]. Although 
the state has a positive duty to provide effective protection to victims o f gender based violence the 
means by which such protection is provided is not mandated  and A  has not established that Reg B13 
will deprive her of a safe haven  [65].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The PSED is a duty on the part of a public authority to follow a form of due process [67]. On the 
history of events and the evidence, the Secretary of State properly considered the potential impact of 
the housing benefit cap  scheme on individuals with disabilities  [68]. Although the Secretary of State  
did not  specifically consider  the impact o f Reg B13 on those within sanctuary schemes, he did address 
the question of gender discrimination [69-70]. The MA claimants’ appeal, and A’s cross -appeal, under 
the Equality Act, are therefore dismissed [71].  
 
Lady Hale, with whom Lord Carnwath agrees, wo uld have dismissed the Secretary of State’s appeal  in 
respect of A. The state has a positive obligation to provide effective protection for victims of domestic 
violence [73]. A failure to do so constitutes discrimination as it has been internationally reco gnised 
that gender based violence is a form of discrimination against women [74]. Sanctuary schemes provide 
such protection [75]. A’s reduction in housing benefit puts at risk her ability to s tay there and 
therefore constitutes discrimination  [76]. DHPs ar e not good enough to justify this  discrimination; it is 
not acceptable for A to endure the additional difficulties and uncertainties involved  in obtaining  them 
[77]. Lady Hale would also have allowed A’s cross appeal. The PSED was not properly complied wit h 
as there was no assessment of the impact of Reg B13 on victims of gender based violence; a 
disadvantage suffered by women who share a protected characteristic [79-80].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Questions of Construction  
 
The general doctrine that exemption clauses should be construed narrowly, has no application to the 
relevant exc lusion in this Policy . The extent of the cover in the Policy is therefore ascertained by 
construction of all its relevant terms without recourse to a doctrine relating to exemption clauses [7]. 
 
The insurance policy  
 
The boundaries of AIG’s liability are a scertained by construing the broad statement of cover and also 
the broad exclusions in the context of the regulatory background  [18]. 
 
Two questions arise: (i) whether the contract between Impact and Barrington was a contract by which 
Impact supplied servi ces to Barrington in the course of Barrington’s provision of legal services; and (ii) 
whether it is necessary to imply a restriction into the relevant Policy exclusion clause limiting its effect 
in order to make it consistent with the purpose of the Policy  [18]. 
 
The DFMA and the resulting loans to Barrington’s clients were a service which Impact provided to 
Barrington for four reasons. Firstly, Barrington contracted as a principal with Impact and not as agent 
for its clients. Secondly, Barrington clearly o btained a benefit from the funding of its disbursements. 
Thirdly, this was not an incidental or collateral benefit to Barring ton derived from a service provided 
to its clients, but was part of a wider arrangement. Fourthly, it was a service for which Barri ngton paid 
the administration fee, undertook the onerous obligation to repay Impact if a client breached the credit 
agreement, entered into the obligation to indemnify Impact and gave the warranty to Impact  on which 
Impact won its claim for damages against  Barrington [29]. Therefore, the DFMA was a contract for 
the supply of services to Barrington [30, 46]. That conclusion accords well with the essential purpose  
of the Solicitors’ Indemnity Insurance Rules 2009  to protect the section of the public that make s use 
of the services of solicitors , the relevant  clause  in the 2009 Rules  being substantially t he same as the 
exclusion clause  [46]. 
 
There is no basis for implying additional words into the exclusion in order to limit its scope. Marks &  
Spencer plc v BNP  Paribas Securities Services [2015] 3 WLR  1843 confirmed that a term would be implied 
into a detailed contract only if, on an objective assessment of the terms of the contract, the term to be 
implied was necessary to give the contract business efficacy or was so obvious it went without saying 
[31]. Impact’s cause of action under the DFMA is an independent cause of action. Excluding such a 
claim creates no incoherence in the Policy. Indeed, it would be consistent with the purpose of the 
Policy of ensuring th at protection was provided to the clients of solicitors if such a claim were 
excluded [32]. 
 
In a dissenting judgment, Lord Carnwath would have dismissed the appeal, finding that the essential 
service provided by the DFMA was the provision of loans to Barr ington’s clients, not to Barrington. It 
may have had incidental  benefits to Barrin gton, but that was not the essential purpose of the contract, 
nor was it a service comparable in any way to the supply of good or services for use in the practice 
[56].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Over the past fifty years there has been progressive reform of provisions discriminating against 
children of  unmarried parents. Since 2006 a person in Mr Johnson’s position has been entitled to 
automatic British citizenship at birth but this change was not retrospective [ 12, 14 -17]. One of the 
benefits of British citizenship is the right not to be deported as a foreign criminal. The obligation on 
the Secretary of State to d eport a foreign criminal does not , however, apply  if removal will breach his 
Convention  rights : s 33(1) UKBA  [18].  
 
The issue before the court was whether the basis for Mr Johnson’s appeal, na mely that to deport him 
would breach his Convention  rights , was clearly unfounded so as to justify the grant of the certificate. 
This raised the question s of whether the rules denying him citizenship  had a ‘one -off effect’ at his birth 
or had continuing co nsequences  which were within the scope of the HRA , and whether this 
discriminatory effect could be justified  [23]. 
 
The right to a na tionality is not as such a Convention  right but denial of citizenship when it has 
important effects on a person’s identity falls within the ambit of article 8 and so triggers the application 
of the prohibition of discrimination in article 14 [ 27].  Birth outside wedlock is a ‘status’ for the 
purpose of article 14 and falls within the class of ‘suspect’ grounds where very weigh ty reasons are 
required to justify discrimination [ 29, 30 ]. In Mr Johnson’s case, what needed to be justified was his 
current liability to deportation when he would not be so liable but for the accident of birth outside 
wedlock for which he was not respons ible. No justification had been suggested for this and it cannot 
therefore be said that his claim that deportation would breach his Convention  rights was clearly 
unfounded [ 34]. 
 
In these circumstances the certificate would be quashed and Mr Johnson’ s appe al allowed to proceed. 
His appeal is also , for the same reasons,  certain to succeed [ 35]. 
 
The court went on to consider whether any of the statutory provisions affecting persons in Mr 
Johnson’s position should be subject to a declaration that they are inc ompatible with Convention 
rights, pursuant to s 4 HRA . It was not necessary to do so in order to dispose of the case , but the court 
makes such a declaration in respect of paragraph 70 of Schedule 9 to the Immigration Act 2014, which  
impose s a requirement t hat an applicant for British citizenship who, but for their parents’ marital status 
would have automatically acquired citizenship at bi rth, be also of good character  [36-39].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal and upholds the decision of th e Court of 
Appeal to quash Ms Mitchell’s conviction  for murder .  In his judgment Lord Kerr (with whom Lord 
Clarke, Lord Hughes, Lord Toulson and Lord Hodge agree) clarifies how juries should treat evidence 
of similar facts or propensity.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The prosecution argued that evidence in relation to propensi ty did not call for any special examination 
by the jury.  It should be considered along with all the other relevant evidence so as to allow the jury to The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 determine whether the defendant’s guilt  was established to the criminal standard .  It was not necessary 
that the issue of propensity be segregated from the generality of the evidence and a pre -emptive 
decision made in relation to that issue, before the question of guilt or innocence of the accused was 
tackled [ 19]. 
 
The respondent  argued that facts supportin g the claim that the defendant had a particular propensity 
had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  It was inconceivable that a jury could have a reasonable 
doubt as to the accuracy or veracity of the evidence said to underpin such a propensity and, 
nevertheless, accept that evidence as sufficient to establish its presence. [ 21]   
 
The Court recognises that there is a distinction between, on the one hand, proof of a propensity and, 
on the other, the individual underlying facts said to establish that a pro pensity exists.  In a case in 
which several incidents are relied on by the prosecution to show a propensity on the part of the 
defendant, it is not necessary to prove beyond reasonable doubt that each incident happened in 
precisely the way that it is alleg ed to have occurred.  Nor must the facts of each individual incident be 
considered by the jury in isolation from each other  [39].  The proper issue for the jury in a case such as 
this is whether they are sure, beyond reasonable doubt, that the propensity h as been proved.  The jury 
is entitled to – and should – consider the evidence about propensity in the round [ 43].  This is both 
because the improbability of a number of similar incidents being false is a consideration for the jury 
and secondly because obvi ous similarities in various incidents may constitute mutual co rroboration for 
those incidents.  
 
Nevertheless, t he existence of propensity must be proved to the criminal standard.  The Court rejects 
the prosecution’s argument that propensity does not call f or “special” treatment.  The jury should be 
directed that if they are to take propensity into account, they should be sure that it has been proved.  
This does not require that each individual item of evidence said to show propensity must be proved 
beyond r easonable doubt.  It means that all the material touching on the issue should be considered 
with a view to reaching a conclusion as to whether they are sure that the existence of a propensity has 
been established [ 44]. There is no need for the jury to cons ider each incident in h ermetically sealed 
compartments  [49]. 
 
In so far as the Court of Appeal in the present case suggested that each incident claimed by the 
prosecution to show a propensity on the part of the defendant required to be proved to the crimin al 
standard, it was wrong.  The proper question is whether the jury is satisfied that a propensity has been 
established.  That assessment depends on an overall consideration of the evidence available, not upon 
a segregated examination of each item of evide nce in order to decide whether it has been proved 
beyond reasonable doubt  [54].   The trial judge failed to give adequate directions as to how the 
question of propensity should be approached by the jury , however .  On that account the conviction 
was unsafe and had been properly quashed [ 56].   
 
The Court  emphasise s, however, that propensity is, at most, an incidental issue.  It should be made 
clear to the jury that the most important evidence is that which bears directly on the guilt or innocence 
of the accu sed person.  Propensity cannot alone establish guilt [ 55].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows Ingenious M edia’s appeal . Lord Toulson, with whom the

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Judicial review is not the only course of action available to challenge t he conduct of a public body. 
Public bodies are not immune from the ordinary application of the common law, including the law of The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 confidentialit y [28]. This case should be approached from the perspective of th e common law of 
confidentiality [17, 28].  
 
It is a well -established principle of the law of confidentiality that where information of a personal or 
confidential nature is obtained or receive d in the exercise of a legal power or in furtherance of a public 
duty, the recipient will in general owe a duty to the person from whom the information was received 
or it relates . The tax affairs of individual tax payers are matters between HMRC and the tax payer, and 
confidentiality is a vital element in the working of the system [17].  
 
However, this principle may be overridden by explicit statutory provisions [18]. By taking together 
ss.5, 9 and 51(2) of the 2005 Act, HMRC’s interpretation of the phrase “disclosure made for the 
purpose of a function” of HMRC in s.18(2)(a)(i), would permit disclosure of  anything which in the 
view of HMRC is necessary, expedient, incidental, conducive to or in connection with the exercise of 
the functions of the collection an d management of revenue. However, if this interpretation was correct 
the provisions permitting disclosure in the specific circumstances in s.18(2)(b) to (j) would be 
superfluou s. Furthermore, such a  construction would run counter to the principle of legali ty, by which 
fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words  [19]. In enacting the 2005 
Act, Parliament cannot have envisaged  that it was authorising HMRC officials such a wide ranging 
discretion to disclose confidential information a bout the affairs of individual taxpayers , limited only by 
the rationality test applied in judicial review claims, as this would significantly undermine  the primary 
duty of confidentiality in s.18(1) [22]. The correct interpretation of Section 18(2)(a)(i) i s that it permits 
disclosure to the extent reasonably necessary for HMRC to fulfil its primary function [23].  
 
It is for the court to  decide whether there has been a breach of confidentiality by a pplying the law to 
its own judg ment of the facts. The opini on of the individual who has disclosed the information is not 
irrelevant, but the court will decide what weight it should be given [26]. This principle applies whether 
the duty of confidentiality is contractual or where, as in the current case, the person or body owing a 
duty of confidentiality holds a public office, is a public body , or is performing a public function, 
subject to any contrary statutory provision [27, 29 ].  
 
An impermissible disclosure of confidential information is no less impermissible be cause the 
information is passed on in confidence, or “of f the record” [31]. The information supplied by Mr 
Hartnett to the journalists about Mr McKenna and Ingenious Media was confidential in nature, in 
respect of which HMRC owed a duty of confidentiality under s.18(1) of the 2005 Act [32]. The fact 
that Mr Hartnett did not anticipate his comments being reported is not a justification for making them 
[35]. The desire to foster good relations with the media and to publicise HMRC’s view about tax 
avoidance sc hemes and speculation that the journalists may have subsequently informed Mr Hartnett 
about other tax avoidance schemes do not provide sufficient justification for  the disclosure s either 
[34]. The disclosures by Mr Hartnett were not therefore justified und er s.18(2)(a) of the 2005 Act [36].

The Supreme Court  refers the question to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Lord Sumption 
gives the reasons for the referral, with which the rest of the Panel agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE REFERRAL  
 
The question referred is whether the Directive precludes the imposition in national law of a requirement 
that, in addition to satisfying the physical, social and psychological criteria for recognising a change of 
gender, a person who has changed gender mus t also be unmarried in order to qualify for a state 
retirement pension [18].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Before 2005, the position under UK law was that a person was treated for all legal purposes as having 
the gender determined by their biological characteristics at birth. In 2002,  the European Court of Human 
Rights deemed that to be incompatible with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights 
(the right to private and family life) and, in so far as it prevented a transgender person from marrying a 
person of the same gende r, incompatible with Article 12 (the right to marry and found a family) [4]. The 
Gender Recognition Act 2004 (which came into force on 4 April 2005) amended the situation such that 
a person’s acquired gender would be legally recognised if they satisfied ce rtain criteria. If a full certificate 
of gender recognition was issued to a person, their entitlement to a state retirement pension would be 
decided according to the rules that apply to the acquired gender  [7]. If, however, a person was married, 
because sa me-sex marriages were not at that time recognised, they received only an interim gender 
recognition certificate which did not change their legally recognised gender but, first, entitled them to 
have their marriage annulled after which a full gender recogni tion certificate would follow [8-9]. Once 
the Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into force in December 2005 a married person who changed their 
gender could have their marriage annulled and subsequently enter a civil partnership with their former 
spouse [10]. 
 
In 2014, that situation was changed by the entry i nto force of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. 
The Gender Recognition Act 2004 was amended so that a full gender recognition certificate could , from 
then on , be issued to a married applicant with the consent of the applicant’s spouse [11]. 
 
MB has argued  that the CJEU has recognised that article 4(1) of the Directive prohibits discrimination 
between persons of a particular birth gender and people who have acquired that gender and, although it 
is for member states to determine the conditions by which someone may acquire a gender, that only 
applies to physical or psychological characteristics  and not to marital status  [15(1) -(2)]. The imposition 
of a marital status criterion on a person who satisfies the state’s physical and psychological criteria must 
therefore be unlawful, and cannot appropriately affect eligibility for state retirement pension [15(3) -(4)]. 
MB therefore argues that the Gender Recognition Act 2004 discriminates against her directly on  the 
grounds of sex, and indirectly because the great majority of people who have undergone gender 
reassignment have been reassigned from male to female [15(5)] . 
 
The Secretary of State argues that the UK procedure by which, for a person’s acquired gender to be 
recognised, a gender recognition certificate must be obtained, is lawful [16(1) -(3)]. There is no reason 
that the conditions for the acquisition of a gender should be limited to satisfaction of physical and 
psychological criteria. Conditions may prop erly reflect social factors  such as the status of marriage, which 
may include a definition of marriage as between a man and a woman [16(4) -(5)]. No question of indirect 
discrimination arises [16(6)] . 
 
The Supreme Court is divided on the correct answer to t he question and, since there is no CJEU 
authority directly in point, it refers the question for their guidance [17].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The 2003 Regulations should, so far as possible, be interpreted in a sense which is not in any way 
inconsistent with the Directives: Marleasing v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentación (Case C -106/89)  
[26]. There is no suggestion in the 2003 Regulations or elsewhere , that the domestic legislator intended 
to do anything other than faithfully implement and give effect to the Directives [28]. 
 
Two questions are central to this appeal. The first  is whether the Directives prescribe any particular 
approach to the scope or measure of recovery applicable in a clai m against a compensation body under 
article 7 of the Fourth Directive (article 25(1) of the Sixth Directive). The second  is if they do, whether 
the language of Regulation 13(2)(b) of the 2003 Regulations reflects this approach, or mandates some 
different a pproach, whatever the Directives may have required  [29]. 
 
As to  the first question, viewed as a whole , the Directives were  and are a scheme of which the constant 
aim has been to improve the prospects and ease with which injured parties can recover the comp ensation 
to which they are “entitled” in respect of any los s or damage caused by vehicles [6-30]. The inference is 
that the victim of a motor accident  is entitled to the same compensation , whether  against the driver 
responsible, his or her insurer, or, that failing, against the motor insurance bureau of the State of the 
accident or indeed the compensation body established in the victim’s state of residence  [31].  
 
Clauses 7.2 and 8.2 of the Agreeme nt provided that the compensation body in the victim’s country of 
residence was to “apply, in evaluating liability and assessing compensation, the law of the country in 
which the accident occurred” . The Agreement needs to be viewed  as part of the wider scheme, which in 
turn needs to  be construed as a consistent whole [33].  
 
The Directives do not leave it to individual member states to provide for compensation in accordance 
with any law that such states may choose. On the contrary, they proceed on the basis  that a victim’s 
entitlement to compensation will be measured on a consistent basis, by reference to the law of the state 
of the accident, whichever of the routes to recovery provided by the Directives he or she invokes. In 
consequence, it also makes no di fference which route is chosen to the measure of liability of the body 
or person ultimately responsible. Since the position as a matter of European Union law is clear, there is 
no need for a reference to the Court of Justice [35-39]. 
 
As to the second question, t he 2003 Regulations were consistent with the scheme of the Directives  [40-
41]. The loss and damage recoverable from the UKMIB is said in Regulation 12(4 )(b) to be that “properly 
recoverable in consequence of that accident by the injured party fr om [the insured] person under the 
laws applying in that part of the United Kingdom in which the injured party resided at the date of the 
accident”. The most obvious purpose of this is to determine which of the United Kingdom’s three legal 
systems should ap ply, rather than prescribing the measure of recovery in such proceedings [42]. The 
decisions in Jacobs v Motor Insurers’  Bureau [2010] EWCA Civ 1208; [2011] 1 WLR 2609 and Bloy v Motor 
Insurers’ Bureau  [2013] EWCA Civ 1543, [2014] 1 Lloyd’s Rep IR 75 shoul d be over -ruled in relation to 
the meaning of regulation 13(2)(b)  [43].

The Reserved M atters C hallenge  
 
Part 4  is challenged  on the  ground that  the data sharing provisions  relate to the reserved matter of the 
Data Protection Act 1998  (“the DPA”)  and Council Directive 95/46/EC  (“the Directive”). Whether a 
provision “relates to” a reserved matter  under the Scotland Act  is determined by reference to its 
purpose  [27-33]. The subject matter of the Directive  (and the refore the  DPA , which implemented the 
Directive  in the UK)  is the standards of protection which must be afford ed to data  and the methods 
by which those standards are secured [ 34-39]. The DPA imposes obligations on data controllers in 
relation to data processing, and creates rights for data subjects  and a system for the regulati on of data 
controllers . Section 35 of t he DPA allows scope for derogation from certain of its requirement s by 
legislation , which may include devolved legislation  [44].  
 
The bodies described in Part 4 as “service providers”  and “relevant authorities” are currently subject to 
legal duties in relation to the disc losure of information as “data controllers” under  the DPA [ 45-47]. 
The result  of these duties  is that information about C& YP can currently be disclosed,  without their 
consent , if the disclosure is necessary in order to protect their “vital interests”, or if the disclosure is 
necessary for the “exercise” of a statutory function. These thresholds are higher than those under Part 
4 which (respec tively) refer  to disclosure being likely to benefit “wellbeing” , and being “likely to be 
relevant to the exercise” of statutory functions . Data controllers are also o bliged to comply with other 
data protection principles under the DPA [ 48]. Further protections are included in relation to 
“sensitive data”  (e.g. health and sexual life)  under Schedule 3 to the DPA  [49-50]. 
 
The effect of Part 4 on the requirements of the DPA is  extremely  complex  and was not fully discussed 
at the hearing . Sections 23  and 26 of Part 4  do not permit  disclosure of information in breach of a  
prohibition or restriction on its disclosure arising by virtue of an  enactment . At first sight, that me ans 
that disclosure under Part 4 is subject to compliance with the requirements of the DPA, since the DPA 
is an enactment. However, under ss. 27 and 35 of the DPA, personal data are exempt from some of 
the requirements of the DPA where the disclosure is re quired by or under any enactment. An Act of 
the Scottish Parliament is an enactment for this purpose. The result is a logical puzzle [51-54]. It is, 
however,  clear that the powers and duties of disclosure under  Part 4  cannot be taken at face value ; in 
several respects, they are significantly curtailed by the DPA and the Directive  [55-58].  
 
However, although Part 4 contains powers and duties the objective of which is to ensure that 
information is shared, that objective is not distinct from the ov erall purpo se of promoting the  
wellbeing  of C&YP  [64]. Part 4 also does not detract from the regime established by the DPA  and the 
Directive [ 65]. Part 4 do es not therefore “ relate to the subject -matter” of the DPA and the Directive  
for the purposes of the Scotland A ct, and the Reserved Matters Challenge cannot succeed  [66].          
 
The ECHR  Challenge  
 
The appellants claim that the NPS breaches  Article 8 ECHR rights. This is  both (a) on the broad basis 
that compulsory appointme nt of a named person without parental  consent amounts to a breach of the 
parent s’ Article 8 rights , and (b)  on the narrow basis that  the information sharing provisions under 
Part 4  amount to breaches of parents ’ and  C&YP’s Article 8  rights  [67-68]. The Community Law 
Advice Network, as intervene r, also challenged the information sharing provisions on the basis that 
they impose too low a threshold for the disclosure of confidential information and amount to an 
infringement  of the Article 8 rights of C&YP . This meant  that there was more focus on A rticle 8  in the  
appeal  before this Court  than there had been before  the Court of Session  below  [69].  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 In the context of the 2014 Act, the i nterests protected  by Article 8 include both family life  [71-74] and 
privacy [75-77], and t he operation of the inform ation sharing provisions of Part 4 will result in 
interferences with  those  interests [78].  
 
In accordance with the law  
 
In order for  that interference to be “in accordance with the law ” (for the purposes of Article 8(2)), the 
measure s must not only have s ome basis in domestic law but also be accessible to the person (s) 
concerned and foreseeable as to their  effects.  This means  rules must be formulated with sufficient 
precision  to give legal protection against arbitrariness [ 79-81]. In assessing the legality  of Part 4, regard 
must be had to the  Guidance  [82].  
 
As is clear from the Court’s findings on the Reserved Matters C hallenge , there are  difficulties in 
accessing the relevant rules  for information sharing . An information holder would need to read 
togethe r and cross refer between Part 4,  the DPA and the Directive in order to work out the priority 
of their provisions. Of even greater  concern is the lack of safeguards which would enable the 
proportionality of an y interference with Article 8  to be adequately examined [ 83-84]. For example, 
information, including confidential information concerning a child or young person’s state of health 
(e.g. as to contraception, pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease), could be disclosed to a wide range 
of authorities wit hout either the child or young person or their parents being aware of the interference 
with their Article 8 rights, and in circumstances in which there was no objectively compelling reason 
for the failure to inform them.  Accordingly , as currently drafted,  the information sharing sections of 
Part 4 and the Guidance do not satisfy  the requirement of being “in accordance with the law” [ 85]. 
 
Proportionality  
 
In assessing whether the operation of Part 4 would give rise to interferences with Article 8 which are  
disproportionate having regard to the legitimate aim pursued, it is necessary to distinguish between the 
2014 Act and its operation in individual cases  [86-88]. Focusing on the proportionality of the 
legislation itself, Part 4 undoubtedly pursues legitima te policy aims and is clearly rationally connected 
to those aims [ 91-92]. Allowing the legislature the appropria te margin of discretion , Part 4 i s also a 
reasonable measure for the legislature to impose  in order to achieve those legitimate aims . It is for this 
reason that  the appellants’ broad challenge  cannot succeed. If  a named person c ould be appointed only 
with parental consent , the scope for early intervention would be diminished  [93].  
 
However, the operation of Part 4  may well  give rise to disproport ionate interferences in particular 
cases :  
 
 First, there is a risk that parents will be given the impression that they must accept advice in 
relation to the services offered by a named person in the exer cise of the named person f unctions, 
and that their fa ilure to cooperate would be taken as evidence of risk of harm. Care should 
therefore be taken to emphasise the voluntary nature of the advice, information, su pport and help 
offered by the named person [94-95].  
 Secondly, the information h older will have to  address difficult questions of proportionality in 
relation to the disclosure of confidential information with the help of only  the Guidance, which is 
limited,  and the  Part 4  criteria , which  set too low a threshold for overriding duties of 
confidentiality [96-100]. There is  therefore a need for  clear guidance to  information holder s as to 
how to assess  proportionality when considering wheth er information should be shared  [101].       
 
The EU Law Challenge  
 
In relation to the EU Law Challenge, there is no inc ompatibility additional to that identified in relation 
to the ECHR  Challenge  [102-105].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Section 106 of the 1984 Act gives a r ight to compensation to a person who has sustained damage by 
reason of the exercise of the authority’s powers under the Act “in relation to a matter as to which he 
has not himself been in default”. This requires firstly, identification of the “matter” in r elation to which 
authority has exercised its powers, and secondly, consideration of whether that is a matter “as to 
which” the claimant has been in default [25].  
 
The relevant power is the power to take emergency action under section 78 of the 1984 Act, a nd the 
claim for compensation  is limited to the period from the date of the Council’s emergency closure of 
the pier until the court order in September 2006  [26]. The “matter” which led the Council to take such 
emergency action was identified in the letter sent by the Council to the tenants at the time, which was 
the state of the pier combined with fear of possible collapse from crowd -loading during the events 
planned for that month, in particular the risk of overloading in an emergency evacuation. The trigg er 
was not the general state of the pier or the specific repairs identified in the report commissioned by 
Stylus . Whatever Stylus’ position towards its clients and employees, it was not “in default” as to the 
matter which led to the Council’s exercise of i ts section 78 powers, and on this basis, Manolete is 
entitled to succeed in its claim for compensation [27-8]. 
 
Although not strictly necessary to determine the present appeal, Lord Carnwath addresses the issue of 
whether “default” in section 106 is limite d to default under the 1984 Act itself, as this may impact on 
future cases. Lord Carnwath finds that the legislative history  and the authorities under the predecessor 
statutes  support  the conclusion that the default is not limited to the particular provisi ons of each 
statute , but extends to other forms of legal default . Concerns as to the wide scope of the factual 
inquiry do not arise if the inquiry is limited to the two -stage assessment set out above [30-5].  
 
The Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the Coun cil had no defence in principle to the claim for 
compensation was correct, not because , as they so held,  there was no default under the 1984 Act, but 
because it was not Stylus’ default which led to the Council’s emergency action [36]. Lord Carnwath 
emphasi ses that this does not limit the issues which can be taken into account by the arbitrator in 
assessing the level of compensation payable. The arbitrator may take account of Stylus’ statutory and 
common law responsibilities to its clients and employees, the  structural condition of the pier and the 
implications it would have had for the continuation of business quite apart from the effects of the 
emergency action [37].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal . Lord Reed, with whom the rest of the Court agrees, 
delivers the  judgment.   
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In the reference, the Supreme Court asked whether a right of permanent residence (“RPR ”) is a 
prerequisite for enhanced protection against expulsion pursuant to article 28(3)(a) of the Directive , as 
the Court of Appeal had held . Pursuant to that article, a n expulsion decision  “may not be taken against 
Union citizens, except if the decision is based on imperative grounds of public security, as defined by member states, if the y 
have resided in the host member state for the previous ten years ”. The CJEU held that RPR is a prerequisite for 
this, because article 28 provides a  graduated scheme of protection, under which the degree of protection 
reflects the individual’s degree of integration into the host member state . [26] 
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecour t.uk 
 In the initial judgment of the Supreme Court, Lord Mance concluded that Mr Vomero  had not acquired 
a right of permanent residence in the UK by the date of the decision to deport him, notwithstanding his 
many years  of residence, because his imprisonment between 2001 and 2006  had t he result that he had 
not resided legally in the UK for a continuous period of five years as at 30 April 2006 , which is when 
the Directive was due to be implemented , or any later date before the decision to deport him . [30] 
 
It is now argued on Mr Vomero’s  behalf that it was wrong for the Supreme Court to conclude that he 
did not have RPR , because the CJEU observed in the course of its judgment that the question referred 
to it was based on the premise that he does not have RPR, and that it did not h ave all the information 
necessary in order to assess whether the premise was correct . In response, the Secretary of States 
maintains that Lord Mance’s conclusion was correct but  concedes that it will be open to Mr Vomero  to 
argue that he has acquired a rig ht of permanent residence since the date of the decision to deport him.  
[31]-[32] 
 
The pr oposition  which the CJEU said that it was unable to assess , namely that Mr Vomero  does not 
have RPR , is not the same as Lord Mance’s conclusion , namely that Mr Vomero  had not acquired RPR 
by 23 March 2007. [33] The same is true of the Advocate General’s preliminary observations. [34]  
 
The leading authority on the significance of imprisonment in relation to the acquisition of RPR  is 
Onuekwere v Home Secretary (Case C-378/12)  [2014] 1 WLR 242 , where the CJEU held that periods of 
imprisonment could not be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the length of the claimant’s 
residence in the UK , and interrupted the continuity of such residence . [42] 
 
The pre sent case differs from Onuekwere  in that Mr Vomero  had completed more than five years  of 
continuous legal residence in the UK before he was imprisoned in 2001.  However, the period of 
imprisonment for more than two years which he had undergone by 30 April 2006 prevented him from 
acquiring a right of permanent residence on that date , in the same way as absence from the UK or being 
out of work for more than two years would h ave done, following Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v 
Lassal (Case C -162/09) [2001] 1 CMLR 31 and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Dias (Case C -
325/09) [2011] 3 CMLR 40 . Accordingly, the  necessary period of five years’ continuous legal r esidence 
could not begin any earlier than when he completed the custodial part of his sentence , and five years’ 
continuous legal residence had not been completed by the time the decision to deport him was made. 
[45] 
 
It will be necessary for the tribunal, when this case is remitted to it, to consider not only whether Mr 
Vomero has acquired a right of permanent residence since the date of the decision to deport him, but 
also whether there still  exist “grounds of public policy or public security ” within the meaning of article 28(1) of 
the Directive on the basis of which his expulsion could  be justified . [47]

The Supreme Court  refers several questions to the Court of Justice  for determination . Lord Mance, with

The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Statements by the European Court of Justice (Grand Chamber)  in Tsakouridis  (Case C -145/09) suggest 
the protection afforded under articles 28(2) and 28(3) of the Directive is intended to be progressive, with 
the possibility of the highest (enhanced) protection only being earned after ten years by those already 
benefitting from the next highest level through having a right of permanent residence  [15-17].   
 
Following the judgment of the Court of Justice ( Second  Chamber) in MG [18-19], it is apparent that t he 
calcula tions  of the time needed to qualify for certain rights  under articles 16  and 28(3)(a) of the Directive 
are differen t. The five -year period  under  article 16  must be continuous but will, once acquired, only be 
lost by absence or imprisonment  lasting two years. The ten -year previous period  under  article 28(3)(a)  
may be non -continuous, where  interrupted by a period of absence or imprisonment. Whether the ten 
years is to be counted by including or excluding any such period of interruption is unclear  [20]. 
  
A majority of the Supreme Court favours the view that possession of a right of permanent r esidence is 
not needed in order to enjoy enhanced p rotection under article 28(3)(a) of the Directive on the basis 
that neither that article  nor the existing case law identifies any need for a right of permanent residence 
in order for an EU  citizen to invok e enhanced protection  [26-27]. 
      
However, there are indications in the Directive that the article 28(2) and 28(3) protections  benefit those 
enjoying rights of residence  and that article 28(3) is predicated upon the enjoyment of such a right.  It is 
open  to suggestion that t he right in question refers most naturally the right of permanent residence 
referred to in article 28(2).  A minority  of the Court  therefore regards the position as unclear and so as 
requiring a reference to the Court of Justice . The Su preme Court therefore refers to the Court of Justice  
the following question :  
 
(1) whether enhanced protection under article 28 (3)(a) depends upon the possession of a right 
of permanent residence within article 16 and article 28 (2) of the Directive . [27] 
 
In the event that this question is answered negative ly, the Supreme Court refers two further questions :  
 
(2) whether the period of residence for the previous ten years, to which article 28(3)(a) refers, is  
(a) a simple calendar period looking back from th e relevant date (here that of the decision 
to deport), including  in it any periods of absence or imprisonment,  
(b) a potentially non -continuous period, derived by looking back from the relevant date 
and adding together period(s) when the relevant person wa s not absent or in prison, to 
arrive, if possible, at a total o f ten years’ previous residence.  
 
(3) what the true relationship is between the ten -year residence test to which article 28(3)(a) refers 
and the overall assessment of an integrative link.  [28]

The Supreme Court unanimously  allows  the insurer’s appeal , restoring the judge’s conclusion that the 
settlement agreement should be set aside  and that Mr Haywar d be paid  the reduced sum . Lord Cl arke 
gives the lead judgment.  Lord Toulson gives a concurring judgment. The other Justices agree with 
both judgments.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The critical  issue on appeal is whether , in order to show  the requisite infl uence by or reliance on the 
misrepresentation in  a claim  to set aside a compromise on the basis of fraudulent misrepresentation , 
the defrauded representee  (i.e. the insurer in this case)  must prove that it settled  because it believed 
that the misrepresenta tions were true. The answer is “no” . There is no aut hority supporting a 
freestanding requirement of belief that the misrepresentations are true . The representee’s state of  mind 
is instead  relevant to , but not necessarily decisive of,  the court’s considerat ion of inducement into the 
settlement agreement , and causation  [18, 23, 25]. There may be  factual  circumstances in which a 
representee knows that a representation is false but nevertheless relies on it, but this is not such a case.  
The insure r in this case  did not know that Mr Hayward  was deliberate ly exaggerating his injuries to 
such an extent as later became clear, and did everything that it could to investigate . Qualified belief in a 
misrepresentation does not rule out the conclusion that the insurer was  induced by it  [20-22, 40].  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square Lond on SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Lord Toulson, concurring, adds that the issue in this case is whether a suspicious insurer, who 
nevertheless settles the claim on the basis that it is likely to succeed but then later discovers a fraud, 
can set aside that sett lement and recover damages for deceit [ 52]. It must be shown that the false 
representation caused the insurer to act to its detriment, but such inducement is always a question of 
fact going to the issue of causation. Mr Hayward’s misrepresentation induced the insurer to enter into 
the settlement agreement  in this case [ 70].  
 
It is not necessary to decide whether knowledge of the falsity of a representation would always prevent 
a representee from nevertheless proving that he was induced by it [ 40-48].

The Supreme Court unani mously allows  Angove’s  appeal  on the first question . D&D’ s agency was 
revoked by Angove’s  termination notice, but  the money s were not held on constructive trust for 
Angove’s . Lord Sumption gives the judgment, with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The authority of an agent is inherently terminable, even where it is agreed to be irrevocable, unless it is 
coupled with a relevant interest of the agent. This requires, in addition to an agreement that the agent’s 
authority is to be irre vocable, that the aut hority is  given to secure a subsisting proprietary interest or 
personal liability of the agent . The mere existence of such an interest will not generally be enough to 
make the authority irrevocable  [7]. Neither of those conditions is s atisfied on the facts of this case. 
D&D’s aut hority was not expressed to be irrevocable  in the agency agreement, and  there is no 
implication to that effect . Because there was n othing in the agreement to stop customers paying 
Angove’s directly, collection o f commission could not sensibly be regarded  as a right or security  of 
D&D . Deduct ion from the price paid by customers was not the only way that D&D could recover its 
commission : customers could pay Angove’s directly, who would  then pay it to D&D [16].  
 
Turning to  the second question,  the argument was that where money was paid for a consideration 
which the payee knew at the time of receipt was bound to fail because of his imminent insolvency, that 
fact alone was enough to give rise to a constructive trust o f the money in the payee’s hands. This 
argument is rejected. The price was paid to D&D by the customers absolutely, in discharge of their 
contractual liability. The judge had held that the agency relationship did not itself give rise to a trust of 
money in  D&D’s hands which they had collected from customers, and that the agency relationship 
between D&D and Angove’s was in the relevant respects one of debtor and creditor. In these 
circumstances the mere fact that it was received at a time when D&D’s personal  liability to account to 
Angove’s would not be performed could make no difference to the basis on which they held the 
money. It did not become unconscionable for them to retain it simply because the statutory insolvency 
regime intervened to require it to b e shared pari passu  with other creditors ( Neste Oy v Lloyd’s Bank Plc  
[1983] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 658 and In re Japan Leasing Europe Plc  [1999] BPIR 911 overruled) [ 31].

 short concurring judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE DECISION  
 
The Department of Health has issued guidelines on the recall of patients to hospital, which set out a 
three -stage procedure  for the communication of reasons  (“the P olicy”) [16]. The Minister  concedes 
that th e second and third stages of the Policy were not implemented:  namely,  an adequate explanation 
was not provided to the appellant within three days of his recall (but only after 15 days) , and no 
explanation in writing was provided within thr ee days (but only months later in th e context of these 
proceedings).  The Minister  further  concedes that this means there has been a breach of the appellant’s 
common law right to have the Policy properly  applied , and his right under Article 5(2) of the Euro pean 
Convention on Human Rights  (“ECHR”)  to be informed promptly of the reasons for his recall [ 17-21].  
 
Legal sufficiency of the Minister’s explanation  
 
The explanation provided to the appellant at the time of his recall (i.e. that it was because of his  
deteriorating mental health) satisfied the first stage of the P olicy. It also complied with the Minister’s 
common law duty to provide reasons [ 24-25]. As for the ECHR, Article 5(2) does not  in this respect  
extend beyond the demands of the common law and , accordingly,  there is no violation  of that article 
[26-32]. The Court of Appeal was therefore correct to find that the Minister’s explanation  at that time  
was legally sufficient, and it is unnecessary to consider the effect of an insufficient explanation [ 32]. 
 
Effect of the Minister’s  conceded  breaches on the legality of detention  
 
The appellant argued  that the Minister’s conceded breaches rendered his detention between the third 
and 15th days follow ing his recall unlawful . As to this, t here is no link, le t alone a “direct link” (as is 
required following R (Lumba) and R (Kambadzi)  [34-35]) between the Minister’s wrongful failure for 12 
days to provide the appellant with an adequate explanation for his recall, and the lawfulness of his 
detention during that 12-day period  [39]. Further,  the consequences of the appellant’ s argument would 
be of concern in other similar cases, given the  need to detain restricted patients under the Act  in 
appropriate circumstances  [40]. The Court of Appeal was therefore right to c onclude that the 
conceded breaches did not render  the detention unlawful [ 41]. 
 
Damages  and declaration  
 
The appellant is not entitled to damages for the breach of his common law right to receive an adequate 
explanation for his recall within the time set o ut by the Policy. The breach does not amount to a tort 
and there is nothing to suggest that damages would have been available in an ordinary action against 
the Minister [ 43]. The conclusion  is the same in relation to the violation  of Article 5(2) ECHR ; the 
appellant has failed to establish that the effects of the breach were sufficiently grave [ 46]. As for a  
formal declaration , it would not add anything to the recording of the Minister’s concessions  in the 
Court’s judgment  [46]. 
 
Lord Reed adds some observations in relation to the consequences at common law of the Minister’s 
failure to comply with the Polic y [48-53].

The Supreme Court  allows  Versloot Dredging’s  appeal  by a major ity of 4 to 1, holding that the 
‘fraudulent device’ rule does not apply to collateral lies, which are immaterial to the insured’s right t o 
recover . Lord Sumpt ion gives the  lead judgment. Lord Clarke, Lord  Hughes and Lord Toulson give 
concurring judgments. Lord Mance  gives a dissenting judgment.   
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The common law  has long prohibited  recovery from an  insurer where the  insured’s  claim has been 
fabricated  or dishonestly exaggerated  (“the fraudulent claims rule”). The purpose of the rul e is to deter 
fraud . This appeal concerns the more recent extension of that rule to “fraudulent devices” , i.e. 
“collateral lies” told by the insured to embellish their claim, but  which  are irrelevant because the claim 
is justified  whether the statement was  true or false  [1,9]. 
 
The fraudulent claims rule does not apply to collateral lies . The dishonest  lie is typically  immaterial and 
irrelevant to the  honest  claim : the insur ed gains nothing by telling it , and t he insurer loses nothing if  it 
meets a liabilit y that it has always had [ 23-26]. If a collateral lie is to preclude the claim, it must be 
material. The real test  of materiality  is that a collateral lie  told in the course of making a claim  must at 
least go  to the recoverability of the claim on the tr ue facts as found by the court [35-36]. The test is  
not, as suggested by Mance LJ in The Aegeon  [2003] QB 556 and the Court of Appeal and Lord Mance The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 in this case,  an attenuated test of materiality requiring that the prospects of the claim should apparently 
be improved,  given the facts known  at the time of the lie  [18-22, 31 ].  
 
Lord Clarke concurs, adding that public policy requires that the collateral lie be irrelevant to the 
insured’s claim, and that it would make little sense to support a rule that bars cla ims involving  collateral 
lies uttered before proceedings are begun, and not afterwards [ 39-49]. Lord Hughes ag rees, pointing 
out that this extension of the important fraudulent claims rule has been left open  by the Insurance A ct 
2015 . The forfeiture of the  entire claim is not a proportionate sanction for the teller of a collateral lie , 
who will suffer in other ways if his lie is discovered  [65-104]. Lord Toulson, concurring, concludes that 
this outcome is just and appropriate [ 105-110].  
 
In a dissenting ju dgment, Lord Mance would have dismissed the appeal, upholding the principle  set 
out in The Aegeon , but modifying it so as to require a heightened threshold test of materiality of a 
“significant improve ment of the insured’s prospects”  at the time of the lie  (rather than retrospectively 
at the time that the court determines the facts),  in order to bar the insured’ s claim [ 111-134].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
It seems instinctively un just for a person to suffer injury as a result of the malicious prosecution 
of legal proceedings  for which there is no reasonable ground, and yet not be entitled to 
compensation for the injury intentionally caused by the person responsible for instigating it  [43]. 
The tort will not deter those who have valid claims. This was the argument advanced for not 
allowing  the tort in criminal  proceedings . It has no greater merit in civil proceedings  [44]. There 
is a public interest in finality and in avoiding unnecessa ry satellite litigation, but an action for 
malicious prosecution does not amount to a collateral attack on the outcome  of the first 
proceedings  [46]. The tort does not create a duty of care. There is a great difference between 
imposing a duty of care and i mposing a liability for maliciously instituting proceedings without 
reasonable or probable cause  [49]. Over the last 400 years there has been a volume of case law 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 
 about malice, and the related requirement of absence of reasonable and probable cause, for th e 
purposes of the tort of malicious prosecution [53]. 
 
To make out malicious prosecution it is well established that the requirements of absence of 
reasonable and probable cause and malice are separate requirements although they may be 
entwined. In order to have reasonable and probable cause, the defendant does not have to believe 
that the proceedings will succeed. It is enough that, on the material on which he acted, there was 
a proper case to lay before the court. Malice is an additional requirement. As applied to malicious 
prosecution, it requires the claimant to prove that the defendant deliberately misused the process 
of the court. The most obvious case is where the claimant can prove that the defendant brought 
the proceedings in the knowledge that the y were without foundation. But the authorities show that 
there may be other instances of abuse. A person, for example, may be indifferent whether the 
allegation is supportable and may bring the proceedings, not for the bona fide purpose of trying 
that issu e, but to secure some extraneous benefit to which he has no colour of a right. The critical 
feature which has to be proved is that the proceedings instituted by the defendant were not a bona 
fide use of the court’s process  [54-55]. The combination of requi rements that the claimant must 
prove not only the absence of reasonable and probable cause, but also that the defendant did not 
have a bona fide reason to bring the proceedings, means that the claimant has a heavy burden to 
discharge  [56].  
 
Lord Clarke delivers a concurring judgment by reference to the arrest of ships, the ingredients of 
the tort of misfeasance in public office and the close affinity between malicious prosecution of 
criminal proceedings and malicious prosecution of civil proc eedings [60-91].   
 
Lord Neuberger delivers a dissenting judgment with twelve reasons for why the tort of malicious 
prosecution should not available in respect of civil proceedings  between one private litigant and 
another as well as in criminal proceedings. The key reasons are that the tort would be inconsistent 
with the general rule that a litigant owes no duty to his opponent in the conduct of civil litigation 
[157] , inconsistent with witness immunity  from civil liability [158] , create a danger  of satellite 
litigation  [163] and may have a chilling effect on the bringing  civil proceedings [166] .  
 
Lord Mance delivers a dissenting judgment. The extension of malicious prosecution is not 
supported by the authorities [95-129] or by policy because, for example, there is no duty of care 
owed between litigants [130-140, see 135] .  
 
Lord Sumption adds a dis senting judgment. When recognising new species of non -consensual 
liability, the common law must develop coherently. The recognition of a general liability for 
maliciously prosecuting civil proceedings circumvents the principled limits that the courts have 
imposed on the tort of abuse [178] . Its developments must also be warranted by current values 
and social conditions. The courts have far more extensive powers today than they did a century 
and a half ago to pr event abuse of their procedures  [179] .  
 
Lord R eed adds  a dissenting judgment  in agreement  with Lords  Neuberger and Mance adding 
observations  including a caution against relying on 16th to 18th century cases in a judgment’s 
reasoning, especially when constructing their historical context may be difficult [182-3].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Mr Mirza’s appeal . Mr Patel is entitled to restitution 
of the £620,000 which he paid to Mr Mirza. Lord Toulson (with whom Lady Hale, Lord Kerr, 
Lord Wilson and Lord Hodge agree ) gives  the lead judgment.  Lord Neuberge r, Lord Mance, Lord 
Clarke and Lord Sumption concur in the result, but by different processes of reasoning.   
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Mansfield  said in Holman v Johnson  (1775) 1 Cowp 341, 343 that “no court will lend its aid to a 
man who founds his  cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act ” [1]. Behind this maxim , there are two 
broad policy reasons for the common law doctrine of illegality as a defence to a civil claim. First, 
a person should not be allowed to profit from his own wrongdoing. Second, the law should be 
coherent and not self -defeating, condoning illegality by giving with the left hand what it takes with 
the right hand [99]. The reliance test expressed in Tinsley  v Milligan [1994] 1 AC 340  bars the 
claimant if he/she relies on the illegality in order to bring the claim. This test has been criticised 
and Tinsley should no longer be followed [110] . 
 
The essential rationale of the illegality doctrine , as explained by the Supreme Court of Canada in 
Hall v Hebert [1993] 3 RCS 159, is that it would be contrary to the public interest to enforce a 
claim if to do so would be harmful to the integrity of the legal system. In assessing whether the 
public inter est would be harmed in that way, it is necessary to consider a) the underlying purpose 
of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enha nced by 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 denial of the claim, b)  any other relevant public policy on which the denial of the claim may have 
an impact and c)  whether denial of the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality . 
Various  factors may be relevant, but the court is not free to decide a case in an undisciplined way. 
The public interest is best served by a principled and transparent assessment of the considerations 
identified, rather by than the application of a formal approach capable of producing results which 
may appear arbitr ary, unjust or disproportionate  [120] . 
 
In considering whether it would be disproportionate to refuse relief to which the claimant would 
otherwise be entitled, as a matter of public policy, various factors may be relevant. Potentially 
relevant factors include the seriousness of the conduct, its centrality to the contract, whether it was 
intentional and whether there was marked disparity in the parties’ respective culpability  [107] . 
 
A claimant, such as Mr Patel, who satisfies the ordinary requirements of a claim for unjust 
enrichment, should not be debarred from enforcing his claim by reason only of the fact that the 
money which he seeks to recover was paid for an unlawful purpose. There may be rare cases where 
for some particular reason the enforcement of such a claim might be regarded as undermi ning the 
integrity of the justice system, but there are no such circumstances in this case  [121] . 
 
Lord Kerr writes a concurring judgment elaborating on aspects of Lord Toulson’s judgment. Lord 
Kerr identifies that there is a choice of approaches between a  rule-based approach on the one hand 
and on the other a more flexible approach, taking into account the policy considerations that are 
said to favour recognising the defence of illegality [133] . A rule -based approach to the question 
has failed to lead to the predictability it sought . Further, it is questionable whether particular weight 
should be given to  predictability where a claimant and defendant have been parties to an illegal 
agreement  [137] . 
 
Lord Neuberger  [143, 163] , Lord Mance  [197-199], Lord Cla rke [210] and Lord Sumption [250, 
253] all conclude there is no inconsistency in the law in permitting a party to an illegal arrangement 
to recover any sum paid under it, so long as restitution is possible. An order for restitution simply 
returns the parti es to the positon in which they would and should have been, had no such illegal 
arrangement been made .  
 
Lord Neuberger goes on however to express the further  view that, in relation to other issues 
involving illegal arrangements, the approach suggested by Lord Toulson provides as reliable and 
helpful guidance as it is possible to give  [174, 186] .  
 
Lord Mance, Lord Clarke and Lord Sumption, in separate judgments expressing general agreement 
with each other, consider that , with the above clarification of the operation of restitution, there is  
no basis for substituting for the clear -cut principle identified in Holman v Johnson and Hall v 
Hebert, founded on the need to maintain the integrity of the law, a mix of factors as a dvocated by 
Lord Toulson, which would not offer the same coherence or certainty  [206-207, 216 -219 and 259 -
265].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows Amoena (UK) Limited’s  appeal . Lord Carnwath gives the 
judgment of the court, with which the other Justic es agree.    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The factual findings of the First -tier Tribunal concerning the design features of the Carmen bra are not 
in dispute [3]. The issue is whether the bra falls under heading 9021 of chapter 90 of the CN 
classification sys tem, which takes effect under EU Regulation 2658/87 [7]. As the Court of Justice of 
the European Union  (“CJEU”)  held in the Uroplasty  case (C -514/04), the intended use of the produc t 
may constitute an objective criterion in relation to tariff classificatio n if it is inherent in the product 
and is capable of assessment on the basis of the products objective characteristics [10].  
 
The Court of Appeal conclu ded with respect to “orthopaedic appliances” that the reference in 
explanatory note 6 to appliances “su pporting or holding parts of the body following an illness, 
operation or injury” d oes not encompass appliances supporting  artificial  body parts such as an artificial 
breast form . Lord Carnwath observes, without ruling decisively on the issue, that the Cour t of Appeal’s 
conclusion  is consistent with the ordinary understanding of orthopaedics and the Advocate General’s 
opinion in the Uroplasty case [22-24].  
 
Under the sub-heading “appliance to compensate for a defect or disability”, Lord Carnwath agrees 
with the Court of Appeal that it is the breast form  which compensate s for the defect or disability, and 
the bra is worn solely to keep it in place [26-28]. 
 
 
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
 
The final sub -heading considered is “artificial parts of the body”. The issue is whether, under not e 
2(b), the bra is a “part” or “accessory” and “suitable for use solely or principally with” the breast form, 
and so should be “classified with” it [29]. This point was answered in favour of the Appellant by the 
Upper Tribunal [31] but reversed by the Cour t of Appeal, based on its interpretation of t hree CJEU 
cases, Turbon 1  (C-276/00) , Turbon 2  (C-250/05) , and Unomedical  (C-152/10)  [33-36]. The two Turbon  
cases, which dealt with ink -cartridges for printers, are of little direct help on account of having su ch 
different facts , but they provide guidance on the meaning of “parts and accessories” , which was treated 
as authoritative in Unomedical [38]. There are difficulties in the reasoning of the CJEU  in defining 
“accessories” , and in the Advocate General’s sug gestion in Turbon 2 that “additional functionality ” is 
required . A better answer is that the second test identified in Turbon 1, whether the item performs “a 
particular  service relative to the  main function” , should be narrowly construed as referring to a service 
directly connected with the mechanisms or processes by which that function  is performed  [41]. 
  
Unomedical , which concerned urine drainage bags , is of more direct relevance to the interpretation of 
heading 9021. What mattered to the CJEU in that ca se was that the bags played no direct part in the 
actual processes of either the catheter or the dialyser  [42]. However, the reasoning of the CJEU  in 
these three cases  is difficult to translate to an artificial breast form, whose function does not depend o n 
any mechanical or other active process  [43].  
 
In agreement with the Court of Appeal , Lord Carnwath does not consider the bra to be a “part” either 
of the breast form on its own, or of a “whole” consisting of the breast form and bra together, as it is 
marketed as an entirely separate product [44]. However, on a natural reading  of the guidance , the bra 
is an “accessory”  because it enables the breast form to perform its function, by holding it in place , and 
thus performs “a particular service relative to (i ts) main function”  [45].

The S upreme Court unanimously allows Mr Kumarasamy’s appeal . Lord Neuberger gives the leading 
judgment, with which the other Justices agree.  Lord Carnwath also gives a short judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
This appeal raises three questions , all of which m ust be answered in the affirmative for Mr Edwards to 
succeed on the appeal  [14-16]: 
 
(1) Whether , in the light of the wording of sections 11(1)(a) and 11(1A)(a)  of the 1985 Act , the paved 
area can be described as part of the exterior of the front hall;  
(2) Whether Mr Kumarasamy had an “estate or interest” in the front hall for the  purposes of section 
11(1A)(a);  
The Supreme Court  of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 (3) Whether Mr Kumarasamy could be liable to Mr Edwards for the disrepair in question 
notwithstanding that he had had no notice of the disrepair in the paved ar ea before Mr Edwards’ 
accident.  
 
Section 11(1) of the 1985 Act , which  implies into certain leases of dwelling -houses a covenant by the 
landlord to keep in repair the structure and exterior of the dwelling -house , applies to the Subtenancy . 
Where the dwellin g-house only forms part of a building, section 11(1A) provides that the covenant has 
effect in relation to any part of the building in which the lessor has an estate or interest [6]. It is not 
possible, as a matter of ordinary language, to describe a path leading from a car park to the entrance 
door of a building as part of the exterior of the front hall  of that building  [17]. Such a  wide reading 
would be difficult to reconcile with the wording of section 11(1A)(a) , particularly the limitation to “the 
build ing”, and the specific extension to cover “drains, gutters and external pipes” , which supports a 
natural reading of the term “exterior” [18].  
 
As to the second question, Mr Kumarasamy was granted a right of way over the front hall and, as a 
matter of prop erty law, a right of way over land constitutes an interest in that land [23]. The argument 
that Mr Kumarasamy cannot be said to have interest in the front hall since the Subtenancy had effectively 
deprived Mr Kumarasamy of any practical benefit in the ease ment so long as it continued is rejected [24-
25].  
 
As to the third question , there is an established rule that a landlord is not liable to repair premises which 
are in the possession of the tenant and not of the landlord, unless and until the landlord has  notice of 
the disrepair  (“the rule”)  [30]. Where a landlord agrees to repair the structure and exterior of a flat, the 
rule would apply but only to the extent that the structure is included in the demise and the tenant is 
accordingly in possession of that  part of the structure [39-40].  
 
The subsequent question is whether the rule can be invoked when a landlord has covenanted with a 
tenant to repair the structure but is not in possession of the structure, for example because he has let it 
to another tenant  [41]. In such a case, the landlord is not normally entitled to notice in such 
circumstances [42-42]. The rule only applies to property in the possession of the tenant [43].  
 
In view of this analysis, Mr Kumarasamy ’s submission that, in every case where a tenant relies on a 
covenant implied by section 11, a landlord could not be liable until they had notice  of the disrepair , even 
where the landlord is undoubtedly in possession of the property,  is rejected [44-46].  
 
The present case is concerned with the application of a landlord’s repairing covenant to property which 
is not in the possession of either the landlord or the tenant. The application of the reasoning upon which 
the rule is based justifies the conclusion that  the landlord’s obligation to repair the paved area is only 
triggered once he has notice of any disrepair for which the tenant would seek to make him liable [49]. 
While it is true that Mr Kumarasamy has the right to use the common parts as against the freeholder, he 
has effectively lost that right for the duration of the Subtenancy to the tenant , Mr Edwards  [50]. It is 
true that the tenant does not enjoy exclusive possession of the common parts, but he is present on them 
every time he comes to or leaves the flat [50] and has the best means of knowing of any want of repair 
in them  [52].

Following a hearing at which the Court heard argument on the ultra vires issue and indicated that it  did

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 796 0 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Public Law Project’s  appeal  on the ultra vires  issue. Lord Neuberger gives the only judgment, with 
which the other Justices agree.     
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDG MENT  
 
The Public Law Project contend that the exclusion of a specific group of people from the right to 
receive legal services on the ground of personal circumstances or characteristics , which have nothing 
to do with the nature of the issue or services inv olved or the individual’s need, or ability to pay, for the 
services , is not within the scope of the power accorded to the Lord Chancellor by section 9(2)(b) of 
LASPO, and that nothing in section 41 undermines that contention.  
 
That argument is accepted by the Court [30]. In declaring subordinate legislation to be outside the 
scope of the statutory power pursuant to which it was purportedly made, the Court is upholding the 
supremacy of Parliament over the Executive [23]. Section 9(2)(b) provides a power to v ary or omit 
services, but the relevant parts of the draft order do not seek to vary or omit services; rather, they seek 
to reduce the class of individuals who are entitled to receive those services by reference to a personal 
characteristics or circumstance  unrelated to the services  (i.e. length of residency)  [30].  
 
This interpretation of the wording of section 9(2) is supported by the wider statutory context. Each of 
the services identified in Part 1 and Part 2 of Schedule 1 is linked to a specific type of  legal issue or 
claim, and has nothing to do with the personal circumstances or characteristics  – in particular the 
geographical residence  – of the potential recipient of the services [31].  
 
This conclusion is also supported by contrasting the wording of the two subsections of section 9. 
Subsection (1) clearly distinguishes between the question of whether the particular services qualify and 
whether the particular individual qualifies [33]. Section 9(2) is concerned with the services which 
qualify, and it i s section 11 which appears to be concerned with identifying the characteristics or 
circumstances of individuals who are to qualify for civil legal aid . The criteria that section 11 sets out 
all relate to the issue involved, the services concerned, or the n eed of the individual for financial 
assistance , in contrast to the draft order . This indicates  that the draft order is attempting to do 
something which the legislature never had in mind when enacting section 9  [34].  
 
The Court of Appeal concluded that sec tion 41 could be invoked to defeat the contention that the 
Lord Chancellor could not make the draft order under section 9 . While it is true that section 41(2)(b) 
permits any order made under section 9(2)(b) to “make provision by reference to… services prov ided 
for a particular class of individual” , this cannot extend the power under section 9(2)(b)  so as  to exclude 
a whole cla ss of individuals from the scope  of Part 1 of LASPO by reference to their residence [36]. 
Section 41 is clearly intended to grant ancillary powers to those primarily granted under section 9 [36]. 
 
Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed on the first, ultra vires, issue, and the Court does not  have to  
deal with the discrimination issue [39].

The Suprem e Court dismisses  Mr Campbell’s appeal  by a majority of three to two. Lord Carnwath 
gives the majority judgment, with which Lord Mance and Lord Reed agree. Lord Toulson gives a 
dissenting judgment, with which Lady Hale agrees  in a separate dissent . 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Carnwath holds that there is no authority for the proposition that a person can be made 
indirectly liable for breach of an obligation imposed by statute on someone else, and that it is only 
possible to pierce the corporate veil  to impose liability on a director or other individual through whom 
the company acts, if  it is expressly or impliedly justified by the statute [13]. In section 5 of the 1969 
Act, Parliament has imposed a specific and closely defined criminal penalty  on a d irector bearing 
responsibility for a failure to insure, which is linked to the criminal liability of the company [14]. Lord 
Carnwath finds that in determining statutory liability, the court must pay due respect to the language 
and structure of the statute,  rather than to preconceptions as to what its objectives could or should 
have been [18]. He rejects the argument that the imposition of criminal liability is sufficient to ren der 
the director civilly liable, finding that other statutory provisions imposing  criminal liability on directors 
for offences by their companies have not been treated as giving rise to civil liability [21-2]. He finds 
that the language in section 5 of the 1969 Act was deliberately chosen and is specifically directed at 
criminal liabil ity, and accordingly it is difficult to infer an intention to impose a more general liability 
[23].

Lord Toulson would have allowed the appeal, finding that the effect in substance of section 5 of the 
1969 Act is to place a legal obligation on a dire ctor or other officer of a company not to cause or 
permit the company to be without the required insurance, on pain of a criminal penalty. He considers 
that t he imposition of criminal responsibility  for a specified act (or omission)  carries with it a legal  
obligation not to act (or omit to act) in such a way [26]. Lord Toulson prefers a functional approach to 
interpreting the legislation which looks to the objective of the statute, which is employee protection 
[30]. However, even on a formalist approach, th e director is in law guilty as a principal of failing to 
insure [31]. Since the Victorian age, the courts have held that breaches of legislation for the protection 
of employees are actionable at common law  by the  employee suffering the breach [32]. If the 
legislation is silent on whether there should be civil liability, the judges’ role is to fill the gaps [34]. 
Where legislation is passed to protect employees, a breach will ordinarily give rise to a cause of action, 
absent a clear statutory intention to th e contrary [41].  
 
Lady Hale agrees with Lord Toulson and would have allowed the appeal. Lady Hale considers it 
absolutely clear that in enacting the 1969 Act, Parliament did intend that failure to insure should give 
rise not only to criminal liability but  also to civil liability towards an employee who had been injured by 
his employer’s breach of duty and who, because of the failure to insure, would not otherwise receive 
the compensation for his injuries to which he was entitled [43]. She stresses that, co ntrary to the view 
expressed by the Inner House, the law has not been changed by recent House of Lords and Supreme 
Court decisions.

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Secretary of State’ s appeal and dismisses  the application 
for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision. Lord Kerr gives the only judgment.  
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Secretary of State contended that service of a foreign judgment could not engage article 6 because 
(1) it does not have the direct consequence of exposing the individual to a breach of any fair trial 
guarantee and (2) the consequences of service are not of a type or nature to warrant the engagement of 
article 6 rights  [13]. Further, the Secretary of State submitted tha t it was not incumbent on her to 
investigate the fairness of proceedings in a foreign state when she was asked to serve a judgment: that 
would run counter to the purpose of the 2003 Act which was to provide speedy and effective procedural 
assistance to oth er sovereign states [15]. For Mr Ismail , it was  submitted that there is a clear discretion 
in the 2003 Act ; that the Secretary of State is required to carefully assess the respondent’s representations 
on article 6 when plausible  evidence of unfairness in the Egyptian trial was provided to her ; and that 
service is more than a merely administrative act [18, 20 ]. 
 
From a purely textual perspective, the wording of the statute suggests an administrative procedure that 
does not routine ly require examination of the proceedings which prompted the request for service [23]. 
On the other hand, the Act provides a power and not an obligation to effect service of foreign process 
and it was therefore contemplated that there would be  circumstance s in which service would not be 
appropriate [26]. 
 
It is well settled that a person physically present in a country which has acceded to the ECHR is entitled 
to its protection, even in circumstances where the actions of a member state would expose them to 
consequences in a non -contracting foreign state which would amount to a violation of Convention rights 
[32]. That, however, is not the context  of this case because the decision of the Secretary of State to serve 
the judgment on Mr Ismail did not expose him  to a risk of violation of his Convention rights [36]. 
Service of the judgment would have undoubtedly placed Mr Ismail in a dilemma – whether to return to 
Egypt to appeal the judgment, or suffer the consequences of the judgment becoming  final – but having 
to face that dilemma does not amount to a possible violation of his article 6 rights [36]. Service of the 
Egyptian judgment does not have a direct consequence of exposing Mr Ismail to “proscribed ill -
treatment”. It reduces his options but does not carry th e inevitable outcome of exposure to a violation 
of his rights. He could avoid that exposure by remaining in the UK [38]. 
 
Service of a judgment is not the same as enforcement of it because it does not give legal force to the 
judgment or ratify it [41]. Service does not, therefore, alter the legal position of the person on whom it 
is served. It may narrow the legal options available to him but his essential legal position remains 
unchanged [42]. Service of the judgment would not involve an exercise of t he UK’s sovereignty  nor 
would it engage Mr Ismail’s fundamental rights. Indeed, in the particular circumstances of this case, it 
would have no material impact on Mr Ismail at all [48]. The Secretary of State was under no obligation 
to investigate further t he consequences that would accrue to Mr Ismail on service of the judgment [52]. 
 
That being said, there may be cases in which service of a judgment would  engage article 6 or would call 
for further investigation of the basis on which the judgment had been obtained. That might occur, for 
instance, where service would lead more directly to enforcement or  have other material consequences 
on the individual. In certain cases service of a foreign judgment might engage article 6. This is not such 
a case [53].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Mance gives the leading  judgment, with

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Although the EU Framework Decision , on which the provisions of section 2 of the Extradition Act 
2003 are based , does not explicitly distinguish between accusation and conviction cases, in practice there 
are significant differences in the bases on which EAWs in each category of case will rest [23-24]. In an 
accusation case, an EAW will normally be based on a domestic arrest warrant whereas in a con viction 
case, the natural basis of an EAW will be an enforceable judgment [25-26]. Where there exists an 
enforceable judgment, there is no reason why there should necessarily be any domestic warrant and, if 
there is, there is no obvious reason why it shoul d be required to be evidenced in the EAW [26]. 
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 A domestic warrant may be required in a conviction case where a person is at large when convicted, has 
absconded, and is wanted for sentencing , and might in such circumstances be regarded as constituting 
the basis of any EAW issued to secure his surrender for sentencing [27]. But, where a person has been 
sentenced to an immediate sentence of imprisonment and is due to be in prison but has absconded, 
there is no obvious reason why there should be any domestic w arrant at all or why, if there is one, it 
should be required to be evidenced in any EAW issued to secure the offender’s return to serve his 
sentence [29]. 
 
The circumstances of the present appeals involve sentence s of imprisonment which did not take 
immedi ate effect. Only the first and third EAWs issued in relation to Mr Sas are presently relevant. As 
regards  the conviction the subject of the first EAW , Mr Sas was free until he lost his appeal, whereupon 
he was summonsed to report to detention, which he failed to do . A court order later issued to secure his 
attendance was irrelevant to the enforceability of the sentence, and could not constitute a warrant for 
the purposes of section 2(6)(c) , and did not therefore need to be particularised in the EAW [31].  
 
As regards  the conviction the subject of the third EAW  relating to Mr Sas , Mr Sas  was given an 
immediate sentence of imprisonment but granted conditional release which was revoked when he 
breached the conditions of his release. When he failed to surrender,  a domestic warrant was issued for 
his arrest [33]. As regards the conviction the subject of the EAW relating to Mr Goluchowski , the 
sentences of imprisonment passed were suspended , but ordered by the court to be serve d when he broke 
certain conditions. In  these circumstances, both Appellants were due to attend prison without more as 
a result of court orders, and only when they failed to obey those orders were any domestic court orders, 
summonses or warrants issued to secure attendance at the relevant corre ction facility [32]. Those 
summonses or warrants are therefore irrelevant to the EAW s, did not need mentioning  in them and did 
not constitute warrants under section 2(6)(c) of the 2003 Act [34]. 
 
It was not necessary for the EAWs to contain e vidence of  the decisions resulting in suspension of Mr 
Goluchowski’s original sentence and subsequent activation of it, nor of Mr Sas’s conditional release and 
the subsequent revocation of that  [35, 42-44]. On the face of the EAWs, details are given of judgments 
which by themselves required the Appellants to begin immediate service of a sentence  [36]. Though 
they do not contain details of every judicial decision by virtue of which the sentence has become 
enforceable, to require such details would (i) mean that an EAW should set out a quite complex history 
of proceedings whereas box (b) of the prescribed form of EAW contemplates a single reference, (ii) run 
counter to principles of mutual confidence on which t he EAW regime is based, and (iii) overlook the 
fact that it is always open to an executing state to request more information from the requesting state, 
as the UK seems to have done in these cases [43]. But a  final decision on the exten t of the details 
required is un necessary since the processes by which the judgments became enforceable is clear from 
the subsequently obtained information, and EU caselaw establishes that an otherwise valid EAW is not 
to be treated as invalid or ineffective merely because the full history is not contained in the EAW itself 
[44]. Even if a reference to the activating  decisions should, strictly speaking, have been made in the 
EAWs alongside the reference to the judgment as enforceable, this cannot mean, under European law 
or the Extradition Act 2003, that the EAWs should be treated as incapable of being executed [45].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGME NT 
 
The Supreme Court has inherent jurisdiction to correct injustice caused by an unfair procedure which 
leads to an earlier judgment  or is revealed by the discovery of fresh evidence , although a judgment cannot 
be set aside just because  it is thought to have been wrong on points unrelated to such procedure or 
evidence [5, 154, 190]. The authorities indicate as the threshold for setting aside a previous judgment 
whether a significant injustice has “probably occurred ” in case of non -disclosure or whether there is a 
“powerful probability” of significant injustice in case of fresh evidence. But Lord Mance le aves open the 
possibility of the egregiousness of the procedural breach and/or the difficulty of assessing its 
consequences militat ing in favour  of a lower threshold , and considers the application on that basis  too 
[8]. An applicant must also show that there is no alternative effective remedy [6].  
 
As to the non-disclosure , the essential questions  are (i) whether due disclosure of the Rashid docu ments 
would have led to a challenge by Mr Bancoult’s representatives to the 2B report in the original judicial 
review proceedings, and, if so, (ii) whether it is likely that such a challenge would have resulted in a 
different outcome to the 2008 judgment  [61].   
 
Assuming without deciding that  (i) was satisfied,  Lord Mance concludes as to (ii), after review ing the 
2008 judgment [16-19] and the Rashid documents [20-64], that t here is no probability, likelihood, 
prospect or real possibility that a court woul d have seen , or would now see, anything which could, would 
or should have caused the respondent  to doubt the conclusions  of the 2B report , or made it irrational 
or otherwise unjustifiable to act on them in June 2004  [65]. As to the alleged new evidence , the first 
head consists essentially of analysis and submissions which the majority takes into account, the second 
and third heads consist of material outside the respondent’s knowledge at the relevant times and neither 
they nor the fourth provide any basis  for setting aside the 2008 judgment [66-71].  
 
Even if the  threshold for setting aside were crossed , circumstances have changed in the light of the 2014 -
15 study  and/or governmental confirmation that the M PA does not preclude resettlement [72-75]. It is 
now open to any Chagossian to mount a fresh challenge to the failure to abrogate the 2004 orders in t he 
light of the 2014 -15 study’s findings, as an alternative to further lengthy litigation  and quite possibly a 
fresh first instance hearing about the factu ally superseded 2B report. [72-76, 78 -79].  
 
Lord Kerr, with whom Lady Hale agrees , would have set aside the 2008 Decision. Although the appellant 
accepted that it must be shown that the non -disclosure probably had, or may well have had, a decisive 
effect on the outcome  [155] , Lord Kerr would have held that it is enough for there to be  a real possibility 
that a different outcome would have occurred had the information been available at the time of the 
original hearing  [160-163]. The Rashid documents might well have caused the 2008 Decision to be 
different [168, 193 ]. Lord Kerr disagrees with the majority that the conclusions of the 2014 -2015 
feasibility study render the present application moot . The mere possibility that the Chagos sians might 
be allowed to resettle  is insufficient. I t would be necessary to demonstrate that they would achieve the 
same result  as would accrue on the successful re -opening of the appeal  [179] .  Moreover, there is no 
question of pragmatic justice being do ne here as t he Supreme Court in this app eal is unable to vindicate 
the a ppellant’s right to resettle in the BIOT  [180] .

The Supreme Court unanimously rules that it does not have jurisdiction to hear the father’s appeal , 
which must therefore be struck out . Lady Hale gives the only substantive judgment .    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Under s 40 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 , appeals to the Supreme Court are subject to 
provision under any other enactment restricting such an appeal. The question therefore is whether the 
provisions of BIIR constitute such an enactment or otherwis e override the jurisdiction granted to the 
Supreme Court by s 40 [ 12]. 
 
The application to regist er a judgment governed by BIIR is intended to be a speedy and essentially 
administrative process. Either party may appeal the decision under article 33, which is subject to the 
provision in article 34 that the judgment given on such an appeal may be contested only by the 
proceedings referred to in the list notified by each member state to the Commission pursuant to article 
68. The UK has provided in its list of notifica tions under article 68 that  appeals in England and Wales The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 under article 34 may be brought only by a single further appeal  on a point of law to the Court of 
Appeal [ 16]. 
 
It has been the practice of the UK in several previous European instruments con cerned with the free 
movement of judgments and judicial cooperation to provide for only one tier of further appeal. The 
purpose of this restriction is to further the intention of these instruments that  member states should 
recognise  and enforce each other’ s judgments  without too many avenues for challenge [ 26].  
 
The provisions of BIIR and the notification under article 68 are directly applicable in the UK. Article 
34 does not depend for its implementation upon the member state’s choice of avenue of appeal and in 
any event the UK did make a notification [ 37]. It is not necessary for the notification to reflect all 
appellate rights under UK law : to further the objective of BIIR, article 68 permits member states to 
make notifications which cut down the routes of appeal which would otherwise be available [ 38]. 
 
It follows that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal in this case and the appeal 
is struck out.

Lord Hughes identifies  four possible  readings of s83: [10] 
1) any grant(s) of leave to r emain totalling more than 12 months bring the claimant within the 
section, whenever they occurred and whether or not they had expired before the asylum claim 
was made and determined ; 
2) grant(s) of leave to remain totalling more than 12 months bring the claim ant within the section 
providing such leave is still current at the time of the de termination of the asylum claim ; The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 3) grant(s) of leave to remain bring the claimant within the section providing that such leave 
totalled more than 12 months counting from the da te of refusal or later grant, and whether the 
grant(s) were made before or after refusal . 
4) grant(s) of leave to remain totalling more than 12 months bring the claimant within the section 
if but only if they (and all of them if more than one) are either cont emporaneous with or post -
date the determination of the asylum claim; this was the Secretary of State’s primary case and 
was adopted by the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal.  
 
Lord Hughes notes that whilst s83 can be read as a matter of language  a numb er of ways, some are 
more natural than others.  In particular, s 83 appears to focus on the time when the asylum claim has 
been rejected, for it is concerned with appeals against this decision, and then to ask whether, when a 
claimant wishes to appeal, the c ondition in subsection 1(b) is met.  [14] 
 
The purpose of s83 is tolerably clear. It is to provide an additional and more targeted right of appeal 
beyond the ordinary one created by s82. It is to provide a vehicle for the determination by the tribunal 
of re fugee status, when that status is asserted but rejected by the Secretary of State, in those cases 
where no such vehicle otherwise exists, nor will exist within a reasonable time.  s83 was designed to 
create  an extra  right of appeal for those who have a longer period of leave to remain  and who would 
otherwise  have no s82 vehicle  which they could use. The intention was that those in this situation  
should not be deprived of the right to challenge the refusal of their asylum claim where that refusal is 
not accom panied by a decision to remove them . [21] 
 
Once  this is understood , it is clear that the construction which most neat ly serves the purpose  of the 
statute is  interpretation  “3”, i.e. that grant s of leave to remain bring the claimant within the section 
provi ding that such leave totalled more than 12 months counting from the date of refusal or lat er 
grant, and whether the grants were made before or after refusal.  [22]

The Supreme Court unanimously grants permission to appeal to Ms Onu but dismisses both Ms Taiwo 
and Ms Onu’s appeal s. It holds  that neither appellant has  suffered race discrimination because the 
reason  for their abuse  by the respondents was not nationality but their vulnerability as a particular kind 
of migrant worker . Lady Ha le gives the only substantive judgment.  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Under s 13(1) Equality Act 2010  (‘EA’)  a person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a 
protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or would treat oth ers. Race is a 
protected characteristic and includes colour, nationality and ethnic origins  [13]. There is no doubt in 
these cases that the  appellants  were treated disgracefully by their employers in a way which employees 
who did not share the appellants’ vulnerable immigration status would not ha ve been treated. The 
question i s whether discrimination on grounds of immigration status amounts to discrimination on 
grounds of nationality [ 14]. 
 
Generally speaking employ ers are free to choose  whom to employ , subject to the limits under the EA 
(and earlier legislation) to protect specified groups , who have historically suffered discrimination , from 
being shut out of access to employment for irrelevant reasons which they can do nothing about  [21]. 
Parliament could  have chosen to include immigration status in the list of protected characteristics but 
it did not do so  [22]. Immigration status is a function of nationality in that non -British nationals (other 
than Irish citizens ) are subject to immigration control, but  there is a wide variety of immigration 
statuses  [23]. The appellants were particularly vulnerable to the abuse they suffered because of the 
terms of their domestic workers’ visas  which meant they were dependent on their current employers 
for their continu ed right to live and work in the UK [ 24]. But there are many non -British nationals 
living and working in the UK who do not share this vulnerability and would not have been abused  in 
the same way. The treatment of the appellants had nothing to do w ith the f act they were Nigerian  and 
they were not  the subject of direct discrimination  [26]. 
 
This was not a case of indirect discrimination. There was no ‘provision, criterion or practice’ as defined 
in s 19 EA applied by the respondents to all their employees reg ardless of their immigration status [ 32].  
 
The present law does not therefore offer redress for all the harm suffered by the appellants. Parliament 
might wish to consider extending the remedy  available under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 to give 
employment tribunals jurisdiction to grant compensation for ill -treatment meted out to workers [ 34].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  Stonegale  and Mr Pelosi junior ’s appeal . Lord Reed gives 
the judg ment, with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Reed finds that the Appellant s’ submission  that the administrators could have pursued a number 
of alternative remedies is not relevant to the issue which this court must determine, which is  whether 
the Respondents are entitled to the remedy they have sought on the basis that the four dispositions are 
gratuitous alienations  [17]. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
Lord Reed holds that the gratuitous nature of the alienations was clearly explained by the Lord 
Ordinary  and is plain and obvious . Prior to the conveyances, the companies owned five properties : 
110, 210, 260 and 278 Glasgow Road, and 64 Roslea Drive. The Anglo -Irish Bank (“the bank”) held 
standard securities over each of these five properties , having made ava ilable to Oceancrown a secured 
facility in the region of 17.3 million, which was cross -guaranteed by the other two companies  [4].  
 
In August 2010 the bank’s solicitors were informed by Mr Robert Frame, a solicitor of Miller Becket 
and Jackson  (“MBJ”) , of the “details of the properties and the relevant sale price” in relation to the 
release of the five properties from the ban k’s securities. The bank’s solicitors were informed that the 
sale prices were as follows: £762,000 for 278 Glasgow Road; £200,000 for 110 Glasgow Road; 
£934,000 for 210 Glasgow Road; £450,000 for 260 Glasgow Road. They were also informed that 64 
Roslea Drive was to be sold for £68,000, bringing the total sale price of the five properties to 
£2,414,000. This information was passed to the bank [6].  
 
On 10 November 2010 the property at 278 Glasgow Road was disponed by Oceancrown  for £762,000 
to a company called Strathcroft Ltd, which was also owned by Mr Pelosi senior. On the same day,  
Strathcroft  disponed the same property to Clyde Gateway  for £2,467,500 , a sum far in excess of an 
earlier valuation of £762,000. The Lord Ordinary found that Strathcroft’s involvement was to “provide 
a short -lived intermediary between Oceancrown and Clyde Gateway”, describing it as “a cog in Mr 
Pelosi’s machin e” [7]. No sales had been agreed in respect of the other four properties  [6]. 
 
Strathcroft , on the instructions of Mr Pelosi senior,  authorised MBJ to send the bank the sum of 
£2,414,000 “in respect of purchases of [the five properties]” on 16 November 201 0, and Mr Frame 
transmitted the money to the bank. The bank then executed discharges  of the standard securities over 
all five properties.  The Lord Ordinary found that “the bank was misled in relation to the funds it 
received”  and that had it known that onl y 278 Glasgow Road was sold,  whilst the overall reduction in 
bank indebtedness would have occurred, the bank  would only have discharged the standard security 
over that property  [8].  
 
As a consequence of misleading the bank, Mr Pelosi senior’s  companies re tained the other four 
properties  valued at £1.525 million , free of the bank’s standard securities [9]. On 24 November 2010, 
110, 210 and 260 Glasgow Road were disponed to Stonegale Ltd and 64 Roslea Drive was disponed to 
Mr Pelosi junior. Nothing was paid for these properties [10].  
 
A loan agreement between Strathcrof t Ltd and Stonegale Ltd  signed by Mr Pelosi junior and dated 16 
November 2010  which  purported to enable the latter to finance the purchase of the properties at 110,  
210 and 260 Glasgow Road  was found by the Lord Ordinary to be a sham, “concocted purely for the 
purpose of the defence of these proceedings” [11].   
 
Lord Reed finds that t here was no reciprocity between  the disposal of the four properties , which were 
gifted to Stonegale Ltd  and Mr Pelosi junior , and the earlier payment to the bank. The transactions had 
the purpose and effect of diverting assets from the companies’ creditors , which was exactly what 
section 242 of the Insolvency Act 1986 is intended to prevent [17].

The Supreme Court dismisse s BNY Mellon’s  appeal  by a 3:2 majority . Lord Neuberger gives the 
leading  judgment, with which Lord Mance and Lord Toulson agree . Lord Sumption gives a short 
dissenting judgment, with which Lord Clarke agrees.     
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Trust Deed  cannot be understood unless one has some appreciation of the regulat ory policy of 
the FSA at and before the time that the ECNs were issued [33]. Thus, the general thrust and effect of 
the FSA regulatory material published in 2008 and 2009 can be taken into account when interpreting 
the T&Cs [33].  
 
BNY Mellon argued that t he December 2014 stress test was not “in respect of  Consolidated Core Tier 
1 ratio ” as specified in clause 19(2) of the T&Cs as CT1 had by this point been replaced by CET1 
Capital [27]. This argument is rejected [35]. The reference to “the Consolidated Cor e Tier 1  Ratio ” 
should, in the events which have happened, be treated as a reference to its then regulatory equivalent, 
being Common Equity Tier 1 Capital  [35].   
 
BNY Mellon’s second argument is that, in order for  it to be said that  the ECNs had not  been taken 
into account, they must be disallowed in principle from being taken into account for the purposes of 
the Tier 1 ratio [27, 40] . The question is whether it is sufficient that the ECNs  continue to be taken 
into account for some purpose in the stress -test, or whether they must play a part in enabling LBG to 
pass that test, which they no longer do [40-42]. 
 
The preferable view is that the ECNs must play a part in enabling LBG to pass the stress -test [45]. 
Under the Regulations  passed in 2013, the ECNs cannot be taken into account so as to do the very job 
for which their convertibility was designed, namely to enable them to be converted before the 
regulatory minimum Tier 1 ratio is reached [45]. This conclusion is also supported by the contrast 
between “cea sed to be taken into account”, the expression in clause 19(2), and a different expression, 
“no longer eligible to qualify”, which is in clause 19(1) [46]. Further, if the contrary view were correct, 
it is very difficult to envisage circumstances in which i t could have been thought that clause 19 (2) 
could have been invoked  [47]. Accordingly, the Trustee’s appeal should be dismissed, on the basis that 
a CDE has arisen under clause 19(2) [54]. 
 
Lord Sumption , with whom Lord Clarke agrees,  dissents  on this poin t and considers that the ECNs 
are not redeemable because, notwithstanding their status as lower tier capital, they would be treated by 
the regulator as top -tier capital in the hypothetical event that LBG’s affairs deteriorated to the point 
where the conver sion trigger was attained [55-62].

 1998 (“the HRA”) and article 8 of the European Convention on Human Right s (“the 
ECHR”) be required to consider the proportionality of evicting the occupier;  
(ii) whether, if the answer to question (i) is yes, the relevant legislation, in particular section 
21(4) of the 1988 Act , can be read so as to comply with that conclusion;  
(iii) whether, if the answer to questions (i) and (ii) is yes, the trial judge would have been 
entitled to dismiss the claim for possession in this case, as he said he would have done.  
 
The appellant’s argument is that the judge should have taken into account the proportionality of 
making an order for possession for article 8 purposes and, on that basis, could have refused to make 
an order for possession despite the apparently mandatory terms of section 21(4) of the 1988 Act and 
section 89(1) of the Housing Action 1980 (“the 1980 Act”) , which limits the period for which a court 
can postpone an order for possession taking effect  [29-30]. 
 
It is well established that it is open to the occupier to raise the question of the proportionality of 
making an order for possess ion where the party seeking possession is a public authority within the 
meaning of section 6 of the HRA  [34]. In deciding this issue in the case of Manchester City Council v 
Pinnock [2011] 2 AC 186, the Supreme Court made it clear that nothing in its judgm ent was intended to 
bear on cases where the person seeking possession was a private landowner [37]. The appellant 
contends that the same reasoning applies to a private sector landlord because the court which would 
grant the order for possession is a public  authority for the purposes of the HRA [38-39]. 
 
The court’s preliminary view is that it is not open to the tenant to contend that article 8 could justify a 
different order from that which is mandated by the contractual relationship between the parties, at  
least where there are legislative  provisions through which the democratically elected legislature has 
balanced the competing interests of private sector landlords and residential tenants [40]. Were it 
otherwise, the ECHR could be said to be directly enfor ceable as between private citizens so as to alter 
their contractual rights and obligations [41]. As to the Strasbourg authorities, the admissibility 
decisions of Di Palma v United Kingdom (1988) 10 EHRR CD 149 and Wood v United Kingdom are 
inconsistent wit h the appellant’s case [48]. While subsequent authorities provide some support for the 
notion that article 8 is engaged on the making of the order for possession against a residential occupier 
such as  the appellant, there is no support for the proposition that the judge could be required to 
consider the proportionality of the order which he would have made under legislation such as the 1980 
and 1989 Acts [49-59]. The appeal is accordingly dismissed on the first issue  [59-60]. 
 
As to the second issue, it wou ld not be possible to read section 21(4) of the 1988 Act in the way 
contended for by the appellant [61-70]. Had the court been persuaded that the appellant was right on 
the first issue , a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the HRA would have  been the only 
remedy [70]. 
 
As to the third issue, the judge did not consider whether, if he had found that the claim for possession 
were disproportionate, there might have been other solutions to the problem than dismissing the claim 
[71]. In those rare cases where a court is required to assess the proportionality of making a possession 
order, its powers to suspend or postpone the effect of that order are severely limited by section 89(1) 
of the 1980 Act [72]. The cases in which it would be justifiable to  refuse, as opposed to postpone, a 
possession order must be very few and far between  and could only be cases in which the landlord’s 
interest in regaining possession was heavily outweighed by the gravity of the interference in the 
occupier’s right to respe ct for her home  [73]. On the facts of this case, it seems likely that the most the 
appellant could hope for on a proportionality assessment would be an order for possession in six 
weeks’ time , the maximum permitted by section 89(1) of the 1980 Act  [75].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The judge ’s approach was correct. No unfa irness had arisen  in consequence of th e irregularities which 
occurred, and there  was no obstacle to the making  of the confiscation order.  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 S.14 allows confiscation proceedings to be postponed until after sentence, for up to two years from 
conviction. Post ponement may be applied for by the parties or may be granted by the court of its own 
motion. If there is a defect in procedure relating to postponement, as there was here, s.14(11) states 
that this alone is not sufficient to require a confiscation order ma de in the defective proceedings to be 
quashed. However, s.14(12) dis -applies s.14(11) where , before the making of a confiscation order , an 
order has been made which s.15(2) says should not precede a confiscation order. Therefore, where 
forfeiture and depri vation orders have been made prior to confiscation proceedings, the rule under 
s.14(11) – that the court is not prevented from making confiscation order s solely because  there was a 
defect in the procedure relating to postponement  – does not apply  [9-14]. The issue in this case was 
whether the dis-application of the s.14(11) bar had the consequence that a confiscation order made 
with a defect in postponement procedure must always be quashed  [18].  
 
Preceding the insertion of ss.14(11) and (12), there was som e uncertainty as to the legal consequences 
of procedural errors. This was clarified in R v Soneji  [2005] UKHL 49 and R v Knights  [2005] UKHL 50 , 
where the House of Lords held that the dominant purpose of POCA was to make confiscation the 
duty of the court.  It would defeat the purpose of the confiscation legislation if orders were treated as 
bad simply because there had been a failure to comply with procedural provisions laid down for 
postponement. The correct approach was to question whether the dut y to mak e a confiscation order 
was removed by procedural errors which caused  injustice or unfairness to the defendant. S.14(11) was 
subsequently introduced with the effect of clarifying on a statutory footing that a procedural error in 
postponement  does not  on its  own invalidate the confiscation procedure [15-17]. 
 
The trial judge’s interpretation of the operation of ss.14(11) and (12) was correct . The fact that the bar 
to quashing a confiscation order in certain circumstances is dis -applied does not give rise to a  
requirement to quash in those circumstances. Where s.14(11) applies, no procedural defect relating to 
postponement can on its own justify quashing. Where s.14(11) does not apply , and there ha s been a 
procedural defect relating  to postponement, an order ma y be quashed, or it may not be. Applying the 
principles in Soneji and Knights , the position is that a procedural defect (not limited to postponement) 
will have the effect of making it wrong to make a confiscation order if unfairness to the defendant 
would ensue. If the order would give rise to no unfairness, or to none that cannot be cured, there can 
be no obstacle to making the order [19-30]. 
 
The Court of Appeal’s interpretation of  s.14(12) as prescribing that an order will be invalidated for a 
procedural  error was wrong. This was to approach s.14(11) as if it restored the position to the pre -
Soneji  case law  which regarded  procedural errors as going to the court’s jurisdiction to make a 
confiscation order. The trial judge was correct to continue to follow the Soneji and Knights approach , 
whose analysis still holds good  [22].  
 
That u nfairness has resulted from a procedural error may be inferred in the event of a very long period 
of inactivity. If the  statutory permitted two -year postponement period is excee ded without there being 
exceptional circumstances, it is likel y that unfairness will ensue . The present case is one where it has 
been accepted that the Respondent cannot point to unfairness, injury or injustice resulting from the 
making of the order after the prescribed timetable. The order was eventually made within the 
permitted period of two years . As there is no unfairness in this case, the question of curable unfairness 
does not arise. If it were to arise, a potential unfairness might be cured for exam ple by adjusting a 
confiscation order, or by quashing a forfeiture order. Each ca se must depend on its own facts [31-4].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Appeal  
 
The powers of the review committee following the original  committee’s direction for a registrant’s 
suspension  are set out in article 54(3)(a) of the 2010 Order. That article does not indicate how the 
powers should be exercised,  and only limited assistance may be derived from the  General 
Pharmaceutical Council (Fitness to Practise and Disqualification etc) Rules 2 010. Rule 34(4) requires  
the representative of the council to inform the review committee of the background to the case and 
sanction previously imposed and to direct its attention to any relevant evidence. Rule 34(4) and (5) 
permit both parties to adduce e vidence “in relation to the person concern’s fitness to practice”. Rule 
34(6) provides that, following a direction for suspension, the review committee “must receive further 
evidence” although the subject of it is not identified. It certainly seems that th e reference to the 
registrant’s fitness to practise relates to his fitness at the time of the review hearing [24].  
 
Greater assistance is collected from the Indicative Sanctions Guidance which makes clear that the 
focus of the review is upon the current f itness of the registrant to resume practice, judged in the light 
of what he has, or has not, achieved since the date of suspension. The review committee asks: does his 
fitness to practise remain impaired [27]. The r ecent work of the three UK Law Comm ission s in this 
area proposes that the review committee should address changes relevant to impairment which have – 
or have not – occurred since the date of the original  committee’s direction [28].  It is also noteworthy 
that in the fifth report of the Shipman  Inquiry, the Chairman stated that review hearings “should focus 
the doctor’s mind on the need to undertake any necessary remediation ” [29]. 
 
The Extra Division’s conception is alien to the generally accepted conception of a review as a vehicle 
for monitoring  the steps taken by the registrant towards securing professional rehabilitation [31]. Taylor 
v General Medical Council  [1990] 2 AC 539, not cited to the Extra Division, expressly holds that the 
conception favoured by the Extra Division is misplaced [32]. In Taylor  the court held that “it can never 
be a proper ground for the exercise of the power to extend the period of suspension that the period 
originally directed was insufficient to reflect the gravity of the original offence” [33]. The Extra 
Division was  too ingenious. There was no middle way. It was wrong to remit the case to the 
committee on that basis [35]. 
 
The Cross -Appeal   
 
The original  committee itself acknowledged that its direction for removal might appear harsh. Serious 
though Mr Khan’s miscondu ct certainly was, t he sanction appropriate to the disrepute into which Mr 
Khan’s conduct had brought, or was likely to bring, the profession of pharmacy was suspension of his 
registration, which, at the time of the committee’s determination, should no doub t have been for a 
period of a year [40]. 
 
A direction for suspension should be substituted in place of the original  committee’s direction for 
removal from the register. In light of Mr Khan’s interim suspension since the date of the original  
committee’s dir ection, the period of his suspension should be four months and a review committee 
should conduct a review prior to the expiry of this period [41].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The public are entitled to the legislative scheme being  underpinned by a coherent view of the meaning 
of the rules and regulations. The  court agrees with the Court of Appeal as to the need for 
rationalisation and simplification [30].   
 
The approach to the present appeals must be ba sed on the legislation as it stands, since there has been 
no challenge to the legality or rationality of the rules and regulations. Ordinary principles of statutory 
interpretation are to be used, starting from the natural meaning of the words in their cont ext. On this 
basis, the Court of Appeal in respect of Mr Iqbal and Mr Mirza reached the correct conclusion. There 
is no ambiguity in the words of regulation 37 of the 2011 Regulations: if an application is not 
accompanied by the specified fee it “is not va lidly made”. An application not validly made can have no 
substantive effect [33]. It does not matter that section 3C was enacted before the provisions of the 
2006 Act or the regulations made under it , because the powers given by Parliament in the later Act  
were made within the same legislative framework as the 2002 Act. This does not equate with 
permitting the executive to alter the interpretation of primary legislation [34]. 
 
The Court of Appeal was also right in rejecting Mr Iqbal’s ground of appeal based  on alleged 
unfairness. The comments of the Upper Tribunal in Basnet do not lay down a universal rule and 
although it is unfortunate that he was caught out by a change in fees, there was no failure by the 
Secretary of State to publicise that change. The pr oblem only arose because the application had been 
made very close to the expiry of leave [35]. 
 
In the case of Ms Ehsan  the situation is slightly different. While the obligation to pay fees arises at the 
time of the application, the requirement to apply fo r biometric information only arises at a later stage. 
Thus, while an application without the fee will be invalid from the outset, it is difficult to see why a 
failure at the biometric information stage should retrospectively invalidate an application from the 
outset, nullifying any section 3C extension to her leave to remain.  There is no reason to read section 7 
of the 2007 Act as having retrospective effect. Rather, the natural reading is to give power to invalidate 
the application from the time of the dec ision. However this reading would not help Ms Ehsan because 
even if her leave continued until the date of the Secretary of State’s decision on 26 March 2012, it 
would not assist her in respect of her new application made on 3 April 2012  [36-7].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Commencement Order setting out transitional provisions for the introduction of LASPO was 
lawful . It did not breach Article 7 ECHR,  it was legitimate ly made  and was rational, and if it was 
discriminatory (which was doubtful) then it was justifiably so .  
 
With the exception of a mandatory life sentence for murder, English criminal sentencing is  a matter 
for the judge. Statute prescribe s the statutory maximum, within which the judge may sentence, taking 
into account the relevant guidelines. The judge must sentence according to the law and practice 
prevailing at the time of sentence, regardless of when the offence was committed . Thus if t he 
maximum sentence has been reduced by statute since the offence was committed, the court will 
sentence within that now current maximum , or if sentencing practice has moved downward, the court 
should sentence in line with that.  
 
Article 7 ECHR requires that there be no punishment without law . This  has always said, explicitly, that 
no sentence may be imposed which exceeds that to which the defendant was exposed at the time of 
committing the offence (“lex gravior”).  Since the statutory maximum for the Appel lant’s offences was 
the same at the time of offence and sentence, the principle of lex gravior is not offended.  The principle 
of “lex mitior” , in contrast,  is that if provision is made by law for a lighter penalty, subsequent to the 
commission of the offen ce, the offender shall benefit from that lighter penalty.  The Strasbourg court 
has held in 2010 in Scoppola v Italy (No 2)  (2010) 51 EHRR 12 that Article 7 also requires compliance 
with this principle.  There are some difficulties in establishing the exact  meaning which the court gave 
to lex mitior, but it is not necessary to resolve them because it is clear that the English practice of 
sentencing according to current law and practice, subject to the statutory maximum obtaining at the 
time of the offenc e (if lower) complies with it. The Strasbourg court cannot have meant that it is 
necessary to examine all intervening rules or practices between the offence and the sentencing process, 
and to sentence according to whichever is the most favourable.  That would not accord with good 
reason or with the rationale of lex mitior, or with the English practice.  Lex mitior is in any event of no 
assistance to Docherty because it does not involve anticipating the commencement of a new and more 
favourable sentencing scheme  [42-49]. 
 
The reading of the provisions of the Commencement Order, together with the provisions of LASPO 
is clear: IPP and EPP disappear from the sentencing armoury on 3 December 2012, except for anyone 
already convicted but not yet sentenced, as in the c ase of the Appellant. There was no breach of 
Article 7 ECHR. In any event, the Appellant’s argument that he should benefit from the accelerated 
removal of IPP from the old scheme but claim the preservation of another pa rt of it (EPP) is 
inconsistent [58].  
 
Further, there was nothing contrary to LASPO’s statutory purpose in the Commencement Order’s 
transitional provisions. s.151 of LASPO enables such an order to be made, and that it may make 
transitional provisions. The phased commencement of the new senten cing scheme was both legitimate 
and rational.  The Appellant’s discrimination argument also fails. It is doubtful whether being subjected 
to a different sentencing regime to another prisoner, due to a different date of conviction, could 
amount to a sufficie nt status to bring it within the anti -discrimination provision of Article 14 ECHR. 
Even if it could, the differential treatment is clearly justified by the need for all sentencing changes to 
start somewhere  [61-63].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In a murder trial where diminished responsibility is an issue, the judge is not ordinarily required to 
direct the jury beyond the terms of the statute, and should not attempt to define the meaning of 
“substantially”. However, if there is a risk that the jury will misunderstand the meaning of substantial, 
then a direction is required. Whether this risk arises is a matter for the judge. This may be the case 
where the jury has been introduced to the question of whether any impairm ent beyond the trivial will 
suffice, or has been introduced to the concept of a spectrum between greater than trivial and total. The 
judge must direct that while an impairment must be more than merely trivial to be substantial, it is not 
the case that any impairment that is  more than trivial will suffice  [43]. 
 
Lord Hughes carrie s out a comprehensive review of the treatment of the expression “substantial 
impairment” in the context of the diminished responsibility defence  in cases from both England and 
Scotl and (from whose common law the English defence was derived). This included the old 
formulation of the defence in the Homicide Act 1957 before it had been amended by the Coroners 
and Justice Act 2009. In the earlier formulation the phrase “substantially imp aired” applied to the 
global concept of mental responsibility, rather than to the ability to do one or more specified things , as 
it now does  [6]. There is no indication that Parliament wished the same expression to carry a different 
meaning in the new the formulation of diminished responsibility, or therefore that the authorities on 
the old formulation should not apply to the new law [30-35]. 
 
In ordinary usage, “substantial” is capable of meaning either (1) “present rather than illusory or 
fanciful, thus h aving some substance”, or (2) “important or weighty”. Either sense can be used in law 
making, and the word may take its meaning from its context. The review of the authorities clearly 
shows that in the context of diminished responsibility the expression “s ubstantially” has always been 
held to be used in the second of the two possible meanings [27].  This meaning of the expression also 
accords with principle – there must be a weighty reason for a reduction from murder to the lesser 
offence of manslaughter, an d not merely a reason which just passes the trivial [36]. 
 
In the authorities reviewed, t he expression “ substantially impaired ” has been consistently treated as a 
question of degree, and one that should be left to the jury . The cases repeated and re -emphas ised, but 
did not attempt to re -define the statutory expression. However, they did proceed on the assumption 
that “substantially” in this context meant impairment which was of some importance, or a serious 
degree of impairment. It was not contemplated in a ny of the cases considered that it was sufficient that 
the impairment merely passed triviali ty [9-26]. 
 
Where triviality was mentioned, as in R v Lloyd  [1967] 1 QB 175, it was in the context of a direction to 
the jury that “substantial impairment” fell bet ween two extremities: more than merely trivial, but less 
than total. It is clear  from the decision in that and other appeals that there was no intention to direct 
that any impairment beyond the trivial sufficed, or that the reference to the extremities of possible 
impairment should provide a definition of substantial impairment. Beyond the merely trivial, what 
amounted to a substantial impairment was a matter of degree for the jury.  
 
There i s usually no need for the jury to be directed on the meaning of or dinary words: any atte mpt to 
find synonyms or re -define such words complicates  the jury’s task and leads to further debate. There 
will be many cases where the need for elucidation does not arise, for example where the  suggested 
impairment, if it existed, i s clearly substantial . If the need does arise, the judge may offer he lp on what 
the expression means , but must avoid substituting a single synonym, and it is usually better to avoid 
the “spectrum” referred to  in R v Lloyd  [37-42].

 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
The Immigration R ules (‘the Rules’) were a relevant and important consideration which the Upper 
Tribunal ought to have taken into account  when  assessing the proportionality o f the interference with 
the appellant’s  article 8 rights . It should also have taken into account that his relationship with his 
partner was formed at a time when his immigration status was such that the persistence of family life 
within the UK was uncertai n [60]. 
The European Court of Human Rights  has provided guidance to the factors which should be taken 
into account  in the  balancing exercise  (for example in Boultif v Switzerland  (2001) 33 EHRR 50 , Maslov v 
Austria  [2009 ] INLR 47 , Jeunesse v Netherlands  (2014) 60 EHRR 17 ). These factors involve wide -ranging 
consideration of the appellant’s circumstances including the nature of his private and family life in the 
UK, his links to the destination country, and the likelihood of him re -offending [26-33]. The we ight to 
be attached to each factor in the balancing exercise falls within the margin of appreciation of the 
national authorities [35].  
The Rules  set out the Secretary of State’s  assessment of the weight generally to be afforded to some of 
these factors. In particular, the Rules prescribe a presumption that the deportation of foreign criminals 
is in the public interest, except where specified factors are present which the Rules accept outweigh 
that interest . Outside of those specified factors  (for example in every case where a custodial sentence 
of 4 years of more has been imposed , as here) , the Rules state that exceptional circumstances – that is, 
compelling reasons – are required to outweigh the  public interest in deportation . The Rules are not 
law, but d o have a statutory basis and require the approval of Parliament. It is within the margin of 
appreciation to adopt rules reflecting the assessment of the general public interest made by the 
Secretary of State and endorsed by Parliament.  [15-23, 36-39]. 
As an appellate body, the Upper Tribunal’s decision making pr ocess is not governed by the R ules, but 
should nevertheless involve their consideration. The Upper Tribunal must make its own assessment of 
the proportionality of deportation , on the basis of its ow n consideration  of the factors relevant to the 
particular case,  and application of the relevant law.  But in doing so, it must not disregard the decision 
under appeal . Where the Secretary of State has adopted a policy in relation to the assessment of 
propor tionality, set out in the Rules and endorsed by Parliament, the Upper Tribunal should give 
considerable weight to that policy. In this case that policy was that a  custodial sentence of four years or 
more represents such a serious level of offending that th e public interest in the offender’s deportation 
almost always outweighs countervailing considera tions of private or family life [39-50, 60 -64]. 
Lord Wilson  adds that public concern (as reflected in the Rules endorsed by Parliament) can assist  a 
court’s ob jective analysis of where the public interest lies  [65-81]. Lord Thomas  emphasises the 
importance of clear reasoning at first instance through a structured ‘balance sheet’ approach [82-84]. 
In a dissenting judgment, Lord Kerr would have allow ed the appeal and upheld the decision of the 
Upper Tribunal. He concluded that the application of the Rules, and their prescription of the weight to 
be given to the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals, were not compatible with the 
balancing exercise that had to be undertaken in considering the relevant factors arising under article 8 
in a particular case . It had been sufficient for the Upper Tribunal to take into account thos e relevant 
factors. Undue or unique reliance on the Rules, at the expense of a comprehensive survey of the 
pertinent article 8 factors was not appropriate.

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Where a decision is taken about the deportation of a foreign criminal who has children residing in the 
United Kingdom , separate consideration of their best interests is required, especially if they do not 
converge with those of the parent to be deported  and particularly in the case of a child with dual ethnic 
background.  The child’s interests must rank as a primary consideration  [40]. 
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The question of whether sufficient considera tion of the article 8 issues which arise in a particular case 
can take place t hrough the application of the immigration rules has been thoroughly discussed in the 
associated case of Ali v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC  60. But the issue in this 
case is si mply whether the Secretary of State was in fact  provide d with sufficient material on which to 
make a proper judgment on  the article 8 rights  of the appellant and his children [ 41].   
 
All the evidence on this issue leads unmistakeably to the conclusion that the appellant did not enjoy 
any relationship with eit her of his children and they led lives which were wholly untouched by the 
circumstance that he was their father. While the possibility of such a relationship developing was a 
factor to be considered, in this case the material available to the Secretary of State could admit of no 
conclusion other than it was unlikely in the extreme. The lately produced information that the mother 
of his son might re -consider contact between them partakes of a last throw of a desperate dice  [42].  
The Secretary of State was t herefore not obliged to make yet further inquiries in relation to the 
appellant and his children beyond those which had already taken place  [44].   
 
Lady Hale adds that c hildren must be recognised as ri ghts-holders on their own account  and not just as 
adjuncts to other people’s rights  [47]. But that does not mean that their rights are inevitably a passport 
to another person’s rights. The problem in this case is that it is the appellant who is treating the 
children as a passport to his own rights, rather tha n as rights -holders in their own right.  His daughter 
is now 19 and has had no contact with him since she was five  [48]. Without a very good reason to the 
contrary, the Secretary of State is entitled to treat the orders of the family courts as reflecting w hat is 
indeed in the best interests of the children concerned. The idea that the Secretary of State should make 
her own investigation of matters which have already been investigated by the family courts is not only 
unrealistic, but would also create uncert ainty and anxiety for the children. Of course it is good for 
children, especially children of mixed ethnicity, to have a relationship with both of t heir parents. But it 
also good for them to have peace and stability. The daughter  is not prevented from esta blishing a 
relations hip with her father by him living  in Tunisia  [49]. There  was no credible evidence that the 
appellant had sought contact with his son and nothing to suggest that the appellant has been making a 
meaningful contribution to his life. He too requires peace and stability and can establish a relationship 
with his father in future should he wish to do so  [50]. 
 
There is nothing at all to suggest that the best interests of these children require  that their father 
should remain in the United Kingd om. Of course there will be cases where fuller inquiries are 
warranted or where the best interests of children do outweigh the public interest in deportation or 
removal, but this is emphatically not one of them  [51].

In respect of the MA claimants ’ discrimination claims , the Supreme Court unanimously allows the 
appeal of Mrs Carmichae l and dismisses the other claimants’ appeals. The MA claimants’ appeals under 
the Equality Act are unanimously dismissed. The Secretary of State’s appeal in respect of the  
Rutherford  family  is unanimously dismissed.  The Secretary of State’s appeal in respe ct of A is  allowed , 
and A’s cross appeal is dismissed,  by a majority of 5 to 2. Lord Toulson gives the lead judgment. Lady 
Hale gives a dissenting judgment in relation to A in respect of both the Secretary of State’s appeal and 
A’s cross -appeal,  with which  Lord Carnwath  agrees.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The normal test in cases involving questions of economic and social policy is whether the 
discrimination i s “manifestly without reasonable foundation” . The question of h ow to deal with the impact of 
Reg B1 3 on individuals with  disabilities is a clear example of a question  of economic and social policy; 
the housing benefit cap scheme is integral to the structure of the welfare benefit scheme. The Court of 
Appeal was therefore correct  to apply this test  [28-38].  
 
In respect of the application of the test, the Court of Appeal was correct that the Secretary of State’s 
decision to structure the housing benefit cap scheme as he did was reasonable [40-41]. However, some 
people with disabilities have a transparent medical need for an additional bedroom . Reg B13 recognises 
this and entitles claimants to  an additional bedroom  in the case of children  (but not adults)  who cannot 
share a bedroom because of their disabilities or adults  (but not children)  in need of an ove rnight carer  
[42]. Mrs Carmichael, is an adult who cannot share a room with her husband due to her disabilities . 
The Rutherfords require  a regular overnight carer for their grandson with severe disabilities . There 
appears to be no reason to distinguish  between adult partners  who cannot share a bedroom because of 
disability and children who cannot do so because of disability ; or between adults and children in need 
of an overnight carer.  The decisions in relation  to Mrs Carmichael and the Rutherfords  were therefore 
manifestly without reason [46-49].  
 
In relation  to the other MA claimants, their need for an additional bedroom is not connected , or not 
directly connected,  to their/their family member’ s disability. Therefore, whilst there may be good 
reasons for them to receive state benefits to cover the full rent, it is not unreasonable for their claims 
to be considered on an individual basis under the DHP scheme [51-54]. 
 
A, has a strong case for staying in her current house; it has been adap ted under the sanct uary scheme 
and she feels safe where she is  [58]. However, there is no automatic correlation between being in a 
sanctuary scheme and requiring an extra bedroom: the reason that A currently has an additional 
bedroom  is that no two bedroom properties  were av ailable when she moved . The Court has 
considerable sy mpathy for A as she has strong social and personal reasons for staying , however, these 
are unrelated to the property size . The fact that people may have strong reasons unrelated to the 
number of bedrooms , for wanting to stay in their property is taken account of through the DHPs. It 
therefore does not follow that A  has a valid claim for unlawful sex discrimination  [59-64]. Although 
the state has a positive duty to provide effective protection to victims o f gender based violence the 
means by which such protection is provided is not mandated  and A  has not established that Reg B13 
will deprive her of a safe haven  [65].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The PSED is a duty on the part of a public authority to follow a form of due process [67]. On the 
history of events and the evidence, the Secretary of State properly considered the potential impact of 
the housing benefit cap  scheme on individuals with disabilities  [68]. Although the Secretary of State  
did not  specifically consider  the impact o f Reg B13 on those within sanctuary schemes, he did address 
the question of gender discrimination [69-70]. The MA claimants’ appeal, and A’s cross -appeal, under 
the Equality Act, are therefore dismissed [71].  
 
Lady Hale, with whom Lord Carnwath agrees, wo uld have dismissed the Secretary of State’s appeal  in 
respect of A. The state has a positive obligation to provide effective protection for victims of domestic 
violence [73]. A failure to do so constitutes discrimination as it has been internationally reco gnised 
that gender based violence is a form of discrimination against women [74]. Sanctuary schemes provide 
such protection [75]. A’s reduction in housing benefit puts at risk her ability to s tay there and 
therefore constitutes discrimination  [76]. DHPs ar e not good enough to justify this  discrimination; it is 
not acceptable for A to endure the additional difficulties and uncertainties involved  in obtaining  them 
[77]. Lady Hale would also have allowed A’s cross appeal. The PSED was not properly complied wit h 
as there was no assessment of the impact of Reg B13 on victims of gender based violence; a 
disadvantage suffered by women who share a protected characteristic [79-80].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Questions of Construction  
 
The general doctrine that exemption clauses should be construed narrowly, has no application to the 
relevant exc lusion in this Policy . The extent of the cover in the Policy is therefore ascertained by 
construction of all its relevant terms without recourse to a doctrine relating to exemption clauses [7]. 
 
The insurance policy  
 
The boundaries of AIG’s liability are a scertained by construing the broad statement of cover and also 
the broad exclusions in the context of the regulatory background  [18]. 
 
Two questions arise: (i) whether the contract between Impact and Barrington was a contract by which 
Impact supplied servi ces to Barrington in the course of Barrington’s provision of legal services; and (ii) 
whether it is necessary to imply a restriction into the relevant Policy exclusion clause limiting its effect 
in order to make it consistent with the purpose of the Policy  [18]. 
 
The DFMA and the resulting loans to Barrington’s clients were a service which Impact provided to 
Barrington for four reasons. Firstly, Barrington contracted as a principal with Impact and not as agent 
for its clients. Secondly, Barrington clearly o btained a benefit from the funding of its disbursements. 
Thirdly, this was not an incidental or collateral benefit to Barring ton derived from a service provided 
to its clients, but was part of a wider arrangement. Fourthly, it was a service for which Barri ngton paid 
the administration fee, undertook the onerous obligation to repay Impact if a client breached the credit 
agreement, entered into the obligation to indemnify Impact and gave the warranty to Impact  on which 
Impact won its claim for damages against  Barrington [29]. Therefore, the DFMA was a contract for 
the supply of services to Barrington [30, 46]. That conclusion accords well with the essential purpose  
of the Solicitors’ Indemnity Insurance Rules 2009  to protect the section of the public that make s use 
of the services of solicitors , the relevant  clause  in the 2009 Rules  being substantially t he same as the 
exclusion clause  [46]. 
 
There is no basis for implying additional words into the exclusion in order to limit its scope. Marks &  
Spencer plc v BNP  Paribas Securities Services [2015] 3 WLR  1843 confirmed that a term would be implied 
into a detailed contract only if, on an objective assessment of the terms of the contract, the term to be 
implied was necessary to give the contract business efficacy or was so obvious it went without saying 
[31]. Impact’s cause of action under the DFMA is an independent cause of action. Excluding such a 
claim creates no incoherence in the Policy. Indeed, it would be consistent with the purpose of the 
Policy of ensuring th at protection was provided to the clients of solicitors if such a claim were 
excluded [32]. 
 
In a dissenting judgment, Lord Carnwath would have dismissed the appeal, finding that the essential 
service provided by the DFMA was the provision of loans to Barr ington’s clients, not to Barrington. It 
may have had incidental  benefits to Barrin gton, but that was not the essential purpose of the contract, 
nor was it a service comparable in any way to the supply of good or services for use in the practice 
[56].

Convention  rights . The consequence is that the certificate granted by the Secretary of State will be 
quashed and Mr Johnson’s appeal against the decis ion to deport him will be certain to succeed. The 
court also makes a declaration that the statutory requirement that a person in Mr Johnson’s position 
must also be of good character in order to be granted British citizenship  is incompatible with

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Over the past fifty years there has been progressive reform of provisions discriminating against 
children of  unmarried parents. Since 2006 a person in Mr Johnson’s position has been entitled to 
automatic British citizenship at birth but this change was not retrospective [ 12, 14 -17]. One of the 
benefits of British citizenship is the right not to be deported as a foreign criminal. The obligation on 
the Secretary of State to d eport a foreign criminal does not , however, apply  if removal will breach his 
Convention  rights : s 33(1) UKBA  [18].  
 
The issue before the court was whether the basis for Mr Johnson’s appeal, na mely that to deport him 
would breach his Convention  rights , was clearly unfounded so as to justify the grant of the certificate. 
This raised the question s of whether the rules denying him citizenship  had a ‘one -off effect’ at his birth 
or had continuing co nsequences  which were within the scope of the HRA , and whether this 
discriminatory effect could be justified  [23]. 
 
The right to a na tionality is not as such a Convention  right but denial of citizenship when it has 
important effects on a person’s identity falls within the ambit of article 8 and so triggers the application 
of the prohibition of discrimination in article 14 [ 27].  Birth outside wedlock is a ‘status’ for the 
purpose of article 14 and falls within the class of ‘suspect’ grounds where very weigh ty reasons are 
required to justify discrimination [ 29, 30 ]. In Mr Johnson’s case, what needed to be justified was his 
current liability to deportation when he would not be so liable but for the accident of birth outside 
wedlock for which he was not respons ible. No justification had been suggested for this and it cannot 
therefore be said that his claim that deportation would breach his Convention  rights was clearly 
unfounded [ 34]. 
 
In these circumstances the certificate would be quashed and Mr Johnson’ s appe al allowed to proceed. 
His appeal is also , for the same reasons,  certain to succeed [ 35]. 
 
The court went on to consider whether any of the statutory provisions affecting persons in Mr 
Johnson’s position should be subject to a declaration that they are inc ompatible with Convention 
rights, pursuant to s 4 HRA . It was not necessary to do so in order to dispose of the case , but the court 
makes such a declaration in respect of paragraph 70 of Schedule 9 to the Immigration Act 2014, which  
impose s a requirement t hat an applicant for British citizenship who, but for their parents’ marital status 
would have automatically acquired citizenship at bi rth, be also of good character  [36-39].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal and upholds the decision of th e Court of 
Appeal to quash Ms Mitchell’s conviction  for murder .  In his judgment Lord Kerr (with whom Lord 
Clarke, Lord Hughes, Lord Toulson and Lord Hodge agree) clarifies how juries should treat evidence 
of similar facts or propensity.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The prosecution argued that evidence in relation to propensi ty did not call for any special examination 
by the jury.  It should be considered along with all the other relevant evidence so as to allow the jury to The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 determine whether the defendant’s guilt  was established to the criminal standard .  It was not necessary 
that the issue of propensity be segregated from the generality of the evidence and a pre -emptive 
decision made in relation to that issue, before the question of guilt or innocence of the accused was 
tackled [ 19]. 
 
The respondent  argued that facts supportin g the claim that the defendant had a particular propensity 
had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  It was inconceivable that a jury could have a reasonable 
doubt as to the accuracy or veracity of the evidence said to underpin such a propensity and, 
nevertheless, accept that evidence as sufficient to establish its presence. [ 21]   
 
The Court recognises that there is a distinction between, on the one hand, proof of a propensity and, 
on the other, the individual underlying facts said to establish that a pro pensity exists.  In a case in 
which several incidents are relied on by the prosecution to show a propensity on the part of the 
defendant, it is not necessary to prove beyond reasonable doubt that each incident happened in 
precisely the way that it is alleg ed to have occurred.  Nor must the facts of each individual incident be 
considered by the jury in isolation from each other  [39].  The proper issue for the jury in a case such as 
this is whether they are sure, beyond reasonable doubt, that the propensity h as been proved.  The jury 
is entitled to – and should – consider the evidence about propensity in the round [ 43].  This is both 
because the improbability of a number of similar incidents being false is a consideration for the jury 
and secondly because obvi ous similarities in various incidents may constitute mutual co rroboration for 
those incidents.  
 
Nevertheless, t he existence of propensity must be proved to the criminal standard.  The Court rejects 
the prosecution’s argument that propensity does not call f or “special” treatment.  The jury should be 
directed that if they are to take propensity into account, they should be sure that it has been proved.  
This does not require that each individual item of evidence said to show propensity must be proved 
beyond r easonable doubt.  It means that all the material touching on the issue should be considered 
with a view to reaching a conclusion as to whether they are sure that the existence of a propensity has 
been established [ 44]. There is no need for the jury to cons ider each incident in h ermetically sealed 
compartments  [49]. 
 
In so far as the Court of Appeal in the present case suggested that each incident claimed by the 
prosecution to show a propensity on the part of the defendant required to be proved to the crimin al 
standard, it was wrong.  The proper question is whether the jury is satisfied that a propensity has been 
established.  That assessment depends on an overall consideration of the evidence available, not upon 
a segregated examination of each item of evide nce in order to decide whether it has been proved 
beyond reasonable doubt  [54].   The trial judge failed to give adequate directions as to how the 
question of propensity should be approached by the jury , however .  On that account the conviction 
was unsafe and had been properly quashed [ 56].   
 
The Court  emphasise s, however, that propensity is, at most, an incidental issue.  It should be made 
clear to the jury that the most important evidence is that which bears directly on the guilt or innocence 
of the accu sed person.  Propensity cannot alone establish guilt [ 55].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows Ingenious M edia’s appeal . Lord Toulson, with whom the

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Judicial review is not the only course of action available to challenge t he conduct of a public body. 
Public bodies are not immune from the ordinary application of the common law, including the law of The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 confidentialit y [28]. This case should be approached from the perspective of th e common law of 
confidentiality [17, 28].  
 
It is a well -established principle of the law of confidentiality that where information of a personal or 
confidential nature is obtained or receive d in the exercise of a legal power or in furtherance of a public 
duty, the recipient will in general owe a duty to the person from whom the information was received 
or it relates . The tax affairs of individual tax payers are matters between HMRC and the tax payer, and 
confidentiality is a vital element in the working of the system [17].  
 
However, this principle may be overridden by explicit statutory provisions [18]. By taking together 
ss.5, 9 and 51(2) of the 2005 Act, HMRC’s interpretation of the phrase “disclosure made for the 
purpose of a function” of HMRC in s.18(2)(a)(i), would permit disclosure of  anything which in the 
view of HMRC is necessary, expedient, incidental, conducive to or in connection with the exercise of 
the functions of the collection an d management of revenue. However, if this interpretation was correct 
the provisions permitting disclosure in the specific circumstances in s.18(2)(b) to (j) would be 
superfluou s. Furthermore, such a  construction would run counter to the principle of legali ty, by which 
fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words  [19]. In enacting the 2005 
Act, Parliament cannot have envisaged  that it was authorising HMRC officials such a wide ranging 
discretion to disclose confidential information a bout the affairs of individual taxpayers , limited only by 
the rationality test applied in judicial review claims, as this would significantly undermine  the primary 
duty of confidentiality in s.18(1) [22]. The correct interpretation of Section 18(2)(a)(i) i s that it permits 
disclosure to the extent reasonably necessary for HMRC to fulfil its primary function [23].  
 
It is for the court to  decide whether there has been a breach of confidentiality by a pplying the law to 
its own judg ment of the facts. The opini on of the individual who has disclosed the information is not 
irrelevant, but the court will decide what weight it should be given [26]. This principle applies whether 
the duty of confidentiality is contractual or where, as in the current case, the person or body owing a 
duty of confidentiality holds a public office, is a public body , or is performing a public function, 
subject to any contrary statutory provision [27, 29 ].  
 
An impermissible disclosure of confidential information is no less impermissible be cause the 
information is passed on in confidence, or “of f the record” [31]. The information supplied by Mr 
Hartnett to the journalists about Mr McKenna and Ingenious Media was confidential in nature, in 
respect of which HMRC owed a duty of confidentiality under s.18(1) of the 2005 Act [32]. The fact 
that Mr Hartnett did not anticipate his comments being reported is not a justification for making them 
[35]. The desire to foster good relations with the media and to publicise HMRC’s view about tax 
avoidance sc hemes and speculation that the journalists may have subsequently informed Mr Hartnett 
about other tax avoidance schemes do not provide sufficient justification for  the disclosure s either 
[34]. The disclosures by Mr Hartnett were not therefore justified und er s.18(2)(a) of the 2005 Act [36].

The Supreme Court  refers the question to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Lord Sumption 
gives the reasons for the referral, with which the rest of the Panel agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE REFERRAL  
 
The question referred is whether the Directive precludes the imposition in national law of a requirement 
that, in addition to satisfying the physical, social and psychological criteria for recognising a change of 
gender, a person who has changed gender mus t also be unmarried in order to qualify for a state 
retirement pension [18].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Before 2005, the position under UK law was that a person was treated for all legal purposes as having 
the gender determined by their biological characteristics at birth. In 2002,  the European Court of Human 
Rights deemed that to be incompatible with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights 
(the right to private and family life) and, in so far as it prevented a transgender person from marrying a 
person of the same gende r, incompatible with Article 12 (the right to marry and found a family) [4]. The 
Gender Recognition Act 2004 (which came into force on 4 April 2005) amended the situation such that 
a person’s acquired gender would be legally recognised if they satisfied ce rtain criteria. If a full certificate 
of gender recognition was issued to a person, their entitlement to a state retirement pension would be 
decided according to the rules that apply to the acquired gender  [7]. If, however, a person was married, 
because sa me-sex marriages were not at that time recognised, they received only an interim gender 
recognition certificate which did not change their legally recognised gender but, first, entitled them to 
have their marriage annulled after which a full gender recogni tion certificate would follow [8-9]. Once 
the Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into force in December 2005 a married person who changed their 
gender could have their marriage annulled and subsequently enter a civil partnership with their former 
spouse [10]. 
 
In 2014, that situation was changed by the entry i nto force of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. 
The Gender Recognition Act 2004 was amended so that a full gender recognition certificate could , from 
then on , be issued to a married applicant with the consent of the applicant’s spouse [11]. 
 
MB has argued  that the CJEU has recognised that article 4(1) of the Directive prohibits discrimination 
between persons of a particular birth gender and people who have acquired that gender and, although it 
is for member states to determine the conditions by which someone may acquire a gender, that only 
applies to physical or psychological characteristics  and not to marital status  [15(1) -(2)]. The imposition 
of a marital status criterion on a person who satisfies the state’s physical and psychological criteria must 
therefore be unlawful, and cannot appropriately affect eligibility for state retirement pension [15(3) -(4)]. 
MB therefore argues that the Gender Recognition Act 2004 discriminates against her directly on  the 
grounds of sex, and indirectly because the great majority of people who have undergone gender 
reassignment have been reassigned from male to female [15(5)] . 
 
The Secretary of State argues that the UK procedure by which, for a person’s acquired gender to be 
recognised, a gender recognition certificate must be obtained, is lawful [16(1) -(3)]. There is no reason 
that the conditions for the acquisition of a gender should be limited to satisfaction of physical and 
psychological criteria. Conditions may prop erly reflect social factors  such as the status of marriage, which 
may include a definition of marriage as between a man and a woman [16(4) -(5)]. No question of indirect 
discrimination arises [16(6)] . 
 
The Supreme Court is divided on the correct answer to t he question and, since there is no CJEU 
authority directly in point, it refers the question for their guidance [17].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The 2003 Regulations should, so far as possible, be interpreted in a sense which is not in any way 
inconsistent with the Directives: Marleasing v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentación (Case C -106/89)  
[26]. There is no suggestion in the 2003 Regulations or elsewhere , that the domestic legislator intended 
to do anything other than faithfully implement and give effect to the Directives [28]. 
 
Two questions are central to this appeal. The first  is whether the Directives prescribe any particular 
approach to the scope or measure of recovery applicable in a clai m against a compensation body under 
article 7 of the Fourth Directive (article 25(1) of the Sixth Directive). The second  is if they do, whether 
the language of Regulation 13(2)(b) of the 2003 Regulations reflects this approach, or mandates some 
different a pproach, whatever the Directives may have required  [29]. 
 
As to  the first question, viewed as a whole , the Directives were  and are a scheme of which the constant 
aim has been to improve the prospects and ease with which injured parties can recover the comp ensation 
to which they are “entitled” in respect of any los s or damage caused by vehicles [6-30]. The inference is 
that the victim of a motor accident  is entitled to the same compensation , whether  against the driver 
responsible, his or her insurer, or, that failing, against the motor insurance bureau of the State of the 
accident or indeed the compensation body established in the victim’s state of residence  [31].  
 
Clauses 7.2 and 8.2 of the Agreeme nt provided that the compensation body in the victim’s country of 
residence was to “apply, in evaluating liability and assessing compensation, the law of the country in 
which the accident occurred” . The Agreement needs to be viewed  as part of the wider scheme, which in 
turn needs to  be construed as a consistent whole [33].  
 
The Directives do not leave it to individual member states to provide for compensation in accordance 
with any law that such states may choose. On the contrary, they proceed on the basis  that a victim’s 
entitlement to compensation will be measured on a consistent basis, by reference to the law of the state 
of the accident, whichever of the routes to recovery provided by the Directives he or she invokes. In 
consequence, it also makes no di fference which route is chosen to the measure of liability of the body 
or person ultimately responsible. Since the position as a matter of European Union law is clear, there is 
no need for a reference to the Court of Justice [35-39]. 
 
As to the second question, t he 2003 Regulations were consistent with the scheme of the Directives  [40-
41]. The loss and damage recoverable from the UKMIB is said in Regulation 12(4 )(b) to be that “properly 
recoverable in consequence of that accident by the injured party fr om [the insured] person under the 
laws applying in that part of the United Kingdom in which the injured party resided at the date of the 
accident”. The most obvious purpose of this is to determine which of the United Kingdom’s three legal 
systems should ap ply, rather than prescribing the measure of recovery in such proceedings [42]. The 
decisions in Jacobs v Motor Insurers’  Bureau [2010] EWCA Civ 1208; [2011] 1 WLR 2609 and Bloy v Motor 
Insurers’ Bureau  [2013] EWCA Civ 1543, [2014] 1 Lloyd’s Rep IR 75 shoul d be over -ruled in relation to 
the meaning of regulation 13(2)(b)  [43].

The Reserved M atters C hallenge  
 
Part 4  is challenged  on the  ground that  the data sharing provisions  relate to the reserved matter of the 
Data Protection Act 1998  (“the DPA”)  and Council Directive 95/46/EC  (“the Directive”). Whether a 
provision “relates to” a reserved matter  under the Scotland Act  is determined by reference to its 
purpose  [27-33]. The subject matter of the Directive  (and the refore the  DPA , which implemented the 
Directive  in the UK)  is the standards of protection which must be afford ed to data  and the methods 
by which those standards are secured [ 34-39]. The DPA imposes obligations on data controllers in 
relation to data processing, and creates rights for data subjects  and a system for the regulati on of data 
controllers . Section 35 of t he DPA allows scope for derogation from certain of its requirement s by 
legislation , which may include devolved legislation  [44].  
 
The bodies described in Part 4 as “service providers”  and “relevant authorities” are currently subject to 
legal duties in relation to the disc losure of information as “data controllers” under  the DPA [ 45-47]. 
The result  of these duties  is that information about C& YP can currently be disclosed,  without their 
consent , if the disclosure is necessary in order to protect their “vital interests”, or if the disclosure is 
necessary for the “exercise” of a statutory function. These thresholds are higher than those under Part 
4 which (respec tively) refer  to disclosure being likely to benefit “wellbeing” , and being “likely to be 
relevant to the exercise” of statutory functions . Data controllers are also o bliged to comply with other 
data protection principles under the DPA [ 48]. Further protections are included in relation to 
“sensitive data”  (e.g. health and sexual life)  under Schedule 3 to the DPA  [49-50]. 
 
The effect of Part 4 on the requirements of the DPA is  extremely  complex  and was not fully discussed 
at the hearing . Sections 23  and 26 of Part 4  do not permit  disclosure of information in breach of a  
prohibition or restriction on its disclosure arising by virtue of an  enactment . At first sight, that me ans 
that disclosure under Part 4 is subject to compliance with the requirements of the DPA, since the DPA 
is an enactment. However, under ss. 27 and 35 of the DPA, personal data are exempt from some of 
the requirements of the DPA where the disclosure is re quired by or under any enactment. An Act of 
the Scottish Parliament is an enactment for this purpose. The result is a logical puzzle [51-54]. It is, 
however,  clear that the powers and duties of disclosure under  Part 4  cannot be taken at face value ; in 
several respects, they are significantly curtailed by the DPA and the Directive  [55-58].  
 
However, although Part 4 contains powers and duties the objective of which is to ensure that 
information is shared, that objective is not distinct from the ov erall purpo se of promoting the  
wellbeing  of C&YP  [64]. Part 4 also does not detract from the regime established by the DPA  and the 
Directive [ 65]. Part 4 do es not therefore “ relate to the subject -matter” of the DPA and the Directive  
for the purposes of the Scotland A ct, and the Reserved Matters Challenge cannot succeed  [66].          
 
The ECHR  Challenge  
 
The appellants claim that the NPS breaches  Article 8 ECHR rights. This is  both (a) on the broad basis 
that compulsory appointme nt of a named person without parental  consent amounts to a breach of the 
parent s’ Article 8 rights , and (b)  on the narrow basis that  the information sharing provisions under 
Part 4  amount to breaches of parents ’ and  C&YP’s Article 8  rights  [67-68]. The Community Law 
Advice Network, as intervene r, also challenged the information sharing provisions on the basis that 
they impose too low a threshold for the disclosure of confidential information and amount to an 
infringement  of the Article 8 rights of C&YP . This meant  that there was more focus on A rticle 8  in the  
appeal  before this Court  than there had been before  the Court of Session  below  [69].  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 In the context of the 2014 Act, the i nterests protected  by Article 8 include both family life  [71-74] and 
privacy [75-77], and t he operation of the inform ation sharing provisions of Part 4 will result in 
interferences with  those  interests [78].  
 
In accordance with the law  
 
In order for  that interference to be “in accordance with the law ” (for the purposes of Article 8(2)), the 
measure s must not only have s ome basis in domestic law but also be accessible to the person (s) 
concerned and foreseeable as to their  effects.  This means  rules must be formulated with sufficient 
precision  to give legal protection against arbitrariness [ 79-81]. In assessing the legality  of Part 4, regard 
must be had to the  Guidance  [82].  
 
As is clear from the Court’s findings on the Reserved Matters C hallenge , there are  difficulties in 
accessing the relevant rules  for information sharing . An information holder would need to read 
togethe r and cross refer between Part 4,  the DPA and the Directive in order to work out the priority 
of their provisions. Of even greater  concern is the lack of safeguards which would enable the 
proportionality of an y interference with Article 8  to be adequately examined [ 83-84]. For example, 
information, including confidential information concerning a child or young person’s state of health 
(e.g. as to contraception, pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease), could be disclosed to a wide range 
of authorities wit hout either the child or young person or their parents being aware of the interference 
with their Article 8 rights, and in circumstances in which there was no objectively compelling reason 
for the failure to inform them.  Accordingly , as currently drafted,  the information sharing sections of 
Part 4 and the Guidance do not satisfy  the requirement of being “in accordance with the law” [ 85]. 
 
Proportionality  
 
In assessing whether the operation of Part 4 would give rise to interferences with Article 8 which are  
disproportionate having regard to the legitimate aim pursued, it is necessary to distinguish between the 
2014 Act and its operation in individual cases  [86-88]. Focusing on the proportionality of the 
legislation itself, Part 4 undoubtedly pursues legitima te policy aims and is clearly rationally connected 
to those aims [ 91-92]. Allowing the legislature the appropria te margin of discretion , Part 4 i s also a 
reasonable measure for the legislature to impose  in order to achieve those legitimate aims . It is for this 
reason that  the appellants’ broad challenge  cannot succeed. If  a named person c ould be appointed only 
with parental consent , the scope for early intervention would be diminished  [93].  
 
However, the operation of Part 4  may well  give rise to disproport ionate interferences in particular 
cases :  
 
 First, there is a risk that parents will be given the impression that they must accept advice in 
relation to the services offered by a named person in the exer cise of the named person f unctions, 
and that their fa ilure to cooperate would be taken as evidence of risk of harm. Care should 
therefore be taken to emphasise the voluntary nature of the advice, information, su pport and help 
offered by the named person [94-95].  
 Secondly, the information h older will have to  address difficult questions of proportionality in 
relation to the disclosure of confidential information with the help of only  the Guidance, which is 
limited,  and the  Part 4  criteria , which  set too low a threshold for overriding duties of 
confidentiality [96-100]. There is  therefore a need for  clear guidance to  information holder s as to 
how to assess  proportionality when considering wheth er information should be shared  [101].       
 
The EU Law Challenge  
 
In relation to the EU Law Challenge, there is no inc ompatibility additional to that identified in relation 
to the ECHR  Challenge  [102-105].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Section 106 of the 1984 Act gives a r ight to compensation to a person who has sustained damage by 
reason of the exercise of the authority’s powers under the Act “in relation to a matter as to which he 
has not himself been in default”. This requires firstly, identification of the “matter” in r elation to which 
authority has exercised its powers, and secondly, consideration of whether that is a matter “as to 
which” the claimant has been in default [25].  
 
The relevant power is the power to take emergency action under section 78 of the 1984 Act, a nd the 
claim for compensation  is limited to the period from the date of the Council’s emergency closure of 
the pier until the court order in September 2006  [26]. The “matter” which led the Council to take such 
emergency action was identified in the letter sent by the Council to the tenants at the time, which was 
the state of the pier combined with fear of possible collapse from crowd -loading during the events 
planned for that month, in particular the risk of overloading in an emergency evacuation. The trigg er 
was not the general state of the pier or the specific repairs identified in the report commissioned by 
Stylus . Whatever Stylus’ position towards its clients and employees, it was not “in default” as to the 
matter which led to the Council’s exercise of i ts section 78 powers, and on this basis, Manolete is 
entitled to succeed in its claim for compensation [27-8]. 
 
Although not strictly necessary to determine the present appeal, Lord Carnwath addresses the issue of 
whether “default” in section 106 is limite d to default under the 1984 Act itself, as this may impact on 
future cases. Lord Carnwath finds that the legislative history  and the authorities under the predecessor 
statutes  support  the conclusion that the default is not limited to the particular provisi ons of each 
statute , but extends to other forms of legal default . Concerns as to the wide scope of the factual 
inquiry do not arise if the inquiry is limited to the two -stage assessment set out above [30-5].  
 
The Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the Coun cil had no defence in principle to the claim for 
compensation was correct, not because , as they so held,  there was no default under the 1984 Act, but 
because it was not Stylus’ default which led to the Council’s emergency action [36]. Lord Carnwath 
emphasi ses that this does not limit the issues which can be taken into account by the arbitrator in 
assessing the level of compensation payable. The arbitrator may take account of Stylus’ statutory and 
common law responsibilities to its clients and employees, the  structural condition of the pier and the 
implications it would have had for the continuation of business quite apart from the effects of the 
emergency action [37].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal . Lord Reed, with whom the rest of the Court agrees,

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In the reference, the Supreme Court asked whether a right of permanent residence (“RPR ”) is a 
prerequisite for enhanced protection against expulsion pursuant to article 28(3)(a) of the Directive , as 
the Court of Appeal had held . Pursuant to that article, a n expulsion decision  “may not be taken against 
Union citizens, except if the decision is based on imperative grounds of public security, as defined by member states, if the y 
have resided in the host member state for the previous ten years ”. The CJEU held that RPR is a prerequisite for 
this, because article 28 provides a  graduated scheme of protection, under which the degree of protection 
reflects the individual’s degree of integration into the host member state . [26]

a right of permanent residence in the UK by the date of the decision to deport him, notwithstanding his 
many years  of residence, because his imprisonment between 2001 and 2006  had t he result that he had 
not resided legally in the UK for a continuous period of five years as at 30 April 2006 , which is when 
the Directive was due to be implemented , or any later date before the decision to deport him . [30] 
 
It is now argued on Mr Vomero’s  behalf that it was wrong for the Supreme Court to conclude that he 
did not have RPR , because the CJEU observed in the course of its judgment that the question referred 
to it was based on the premise that he does not have RPR, and that it did not h ave all the information 
necessary in order to assess whether the premise was correct . In response, the Secretary of States 
maintains that Lord Mance’s conclusion was correct but  concedes that it will be open to Mr Vomero  to 
argue that he has acquired a rig ht of permanent residence since the date of the decision to deport him.  
[31]-[32] 
 
The pr oposition  which the CJEU said that it was unable to assess , namely that Mr Vomero  does not 
have RPR , is not the same as Lord Mance’s conclusion , namely that Mr Vomero  had not acquired RPR 
by 23 March 2007. [33] The same is true of the Advocate General’s preliminary observations. [34]  
 
The leading authority on the significance of imprisonment in relation to the acquisition of RPR  is 
Onuekwere v Home Secretary (Case C-378/12)  [2014] 1 WLR 242 , where the CJEU held that periods of 
imprisonment could not be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the length of the claimant’s 
residence in the UK , and interrupted the continuity of such residence . [42] 
 
The pre sent case differs from Onuekwere  in that Mr Vomero  had completed more than five years  of 
continuous legal residence in the UK before he was imprisoned in 2001.  However, the period of 
imprisonment for more than two years which he had undergone by 30 April 2006 prevented him from 
acquiring a right of permanent residence on that date , in the same way as absence from the UK or being 
out of work for more than two years would h ave done, following Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v 
Lassal (Case C -162/09) [2001] 1 CMLR 31 and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Dias (Case C -
325/09) [2011] 3 CMLR 40 . Accordingly, the  necessary period of five years’ continuous legal r esidence 
could not begin any earlier than when he completed the custodial part of his sentence , and five years’ 
continuous legal residence had not been completed by the time the decision to deport him was made. 
[45] 
 
It will be necessary for the tribunal, when this case is remitted to it, to consider not only whether Mr 
Vomero has acquired a right of permanent residence since the date of the decision to deport him, but 
also whether there still  exist “grounds of public policy or public security ” within the meaning of article 28(1) of 
the Directive on the basis of which his expulsion could  be justified . [47]

The Supreme Court  refers several questions to the Court of Justice  for determination . Lord Mance, with 
whom the other Justices agree, gives the lead judgment.  
 
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Statements by the European Court of Justice (Grand Chamber)  in Tsakouridis  (Case C -145/09) suggest 
the protection afforded under articles 28(2) and 28(3) of the Directive is intended to be progressive, with 
the possibility of the highest (enhanced) protection only being earned after ten years by those already 
benefitting from the next highest level through having a right of permanent residence  [15-17].   
 
Following the judgment of the Court of Justice ( Second  Chamber) in MG [18-19], it is apparent that t he 
calcula tions  of the time needed to qualify for certain rights  under articles 16  and 28(3)(a) of the Directive 
are differen t. The five -year period  under  article 16  must be continuous but will, once acquired, only be 
lost by absence or imprisonment  lasting two years. The ten -year previous period  under  article 28(3)(a)  
may be non -continuous, where  interrupted by a period of absence or imprisonment. Whether the ten 
years is to be counted by including or excluding any such period of interruption is unclear  [20]. 
  
A majority of the Supreme Court favours the view that possession of a right of permanent r esidence is 
not needed in order to enjoy enhanced p rotection under article 28(3)(a) of the Directive on the basis 
that neither that article  nor the existing case law identifies any need for a right of permanent residence 
in order for an EU  citizen to invok e enhanced protection  [26-27]. 
      
However, there are indications in the Directive that the article 28(2) and 28(3) protections  benefit those 
enjoying rights of residence  and that article 28(3) is predicated upon the enjoyment of such a right.  It is 
open  to suggestion that t he right in question refers most naturally the right of permanent residence 
referred to in article 28(2).  A minority  of the Court  therefore regards the position as unclear and so as 
requiring a reference to the Court of Justice . The Su preme Court therefore refers to the Court of Justice  
the following question :  
 
(1) whether enhanced protection under article 28 (3)(a) depends upon the possession of a right 
of permanent residence within article 16 and article 28 (2) of the Directive . [27] 
 
In the event that this question is answered negative ly, the Supreme Court refers two further questions :  
 
(2) whether the period of residence for the previous ten years, to which article 28(3)(a) refers, is  
(a) a simple calendar period looking back from th e relevant date (here that of the decision 
to deport), including  in it any periods of absence or imprisonment,  
(b) a potentially non -continuous period, derived by looking back from the relevant date 
and adding together period(s) when the relevant person wa s not absent or in prison, to 
arrive, if possible, at a total o f ten years’ previous residence.  
 
(3) what the true relationship is between the ten -year residence test to which article 28(3)(a) refers 
and the overall assessment of an integrative link.  [28]

The Supreme Court unanimously  allows  the insurer’s appeal , restoring the judge’s conclusion that the 
settlement agreement should be set aside  and that Mr Haywar d be paid  the reduced sum . Lord Cl arke 
gives the lead judgment.  Lord Toulson gives a concurring judgment. The other Justices agree with 
both judgments.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The critical  issue on appeal is whether , in order to show  the requisite infl uence by or reliance on the 
misrepresentation in  a claim  to set aside a compromise on the basis of fraudulent misrepresentation , 
the defrauded representee  (i.e. the insurer in this case)  must prove that it settled  because it believed 
that the misrepresenta tions were true. The answer is “no” . There is no aut hority supporting a 
freestanding requirement of belief that the misrepresentations are true . The representee’s state of  mind 
is instead  relevant to , but not necessarily decisive of,  the court’s considerat ion of inducement into the 
settlement agreement , and causation  [18, 23, 25]. There may be  factual  circumstances in which a 
representee knows that a representation is false but nevertheless relies on it, but this is not such a case.  
The insure r in this case  did not know that Mr Hayward  was deliberate ly exaggerating his injuries to 
such an extent as later became clear, and did everything that it could to investigate . Qualified belief in a 
misrepresentation does not rule out the conclusion that the insurer was  induced by it  [20-22, 40].  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square Lond on SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Lord Toulson, concurring, adds that the issue in this case is whether a suspicious insurer, who 
nevertheless settles the claim on the basis that it is likely to succeed but then later discovers a fraud, 
can set aside that sett lement and recover damages for deceit [ 52]. It must be shown that the false 
representation caused the insurer to act to its detriment, but such inducement is always a question of 
fact going to the issue of causation. Mr Hayward’s misrepresentation induced the insurer to enter into 
the settlement agreement  in this case [ 70].  
 
It is not necessary to decide whether knowledge of the falsity of a representation would always prevent 
a representee from nevertheless proving that he was induced by it [ 40-48].

The Supreme Court unani mously allows  Angove’s  appeal  on the first question . D&D’ s agency was 
revoked by Angove’s  termination notice, but  the money s were not held on constructive trust for 
Angove’s . Lord Sumption gives the judgment, with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The authority of an agent is inherently terminable, even where it is agreed to be irrevocable, unless it is 
coupled with a relevant interest of the agent. This requires, in addition to an agreement that the agent’s 
authority is to be irre vocable, that the aut hority is  given to secure a subsisting proprietary interest or 
personal liability of the agent . The mere existence of such an interest will not generally be enough to 
make the authority irrevocable  [7]. Neither of those conditions is s atisfied on the facts of this case. 
D&D’s aut hority was not expressed to be irrevocable  in the agency agreement, and  there is no 
implication to that effect . Because there was n othing in the agreement to stop customers paying 
Angove’s directly, collection o f commission could not sensibly be regarded  as a right or security  of 
D&D . Deduct ion from the price paid by customers was not the only way that D&D could recover its 
commission : customers could pay Angove’s directly, who would  then pay it to D&D [16].  
 
Turning to  the second question,  the argument was that where money was paid for a consideration 
which the payee knew at the time of receipt was bound to fail because of his imminent insolvency, that 
fact alone was enough to give rise to a constructive trust o f the money in the payee’s hands. This 
argument is rejected. The price was paid to D&D by the customers absolutely, in discharge of their 
contractual liability. The judge had held that the agency relationship did not itself give rise to a trust of 
money in  D&D’s hands which they had collected from customers, and that the agency relationship 
between D&D and Angove’s was in the relevant respects one of debtor and creditor. In these 
circumstances the mere fact that it was received at a time when D&D’s personal  liability to account to 
Angove’s would not be performed could make no difference to the basis on which they held the 
money. It did not become unconscionable for them to retain it simply because the statutory insolvency 
regime intervened to require it to b e shared pari passu  with other creditors ( Neste Oy v Lloyd’s Bank Plc  
[1983] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 658 and In re Japan Leasing Europe Plc  [1999] BPIR 911 overruled) [ 31].

 short concurring judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE DECISION  
 
The Department of Health has issued guidelines on the recall of patients to hospital, which set out a 
three -stage procedure  for the communication of reasons  (“the P olicy”) [16]. The Minister  concedes 
that th e second and third stages of the Policy were not implemented:  namely,  an adequate explanation 
was not provided to the appellant within three days of his recall (but only after 15 days) , and no 
explanation in writing was provided within thr ee days (but only months later in th e context of these 
proceedings).  The Minister  further  concedes that this means there has been a breach of the appellant’s 
common law right to have the Policy properly  applied , and his right under Article 5(2) of the Euro pean 
Convention on Human Rights  (“ECHR”)  to be informed promptly of the reasons for his recall [ 17-21].  
 
Legal sufficiency of the Minister’s explanation  
 
The explanation provided to the appellant at the time of his recall (i.e. that it was because of his  
deteriorating mental health) satisfied the first stage of the P olicy. It also complied with the Minister’s 
common law duty to provide reasons [ 24-25]. As for the ECHR, Article 5(2) does not  in this respect  
extend beyond the demands of the common law and , accordingly,  there is no violation  of that article 
[26-32]. The Court of Appeal was therefore correct to find that the Minister’s explanation  at that time  
was legally sufficient, and it is unnecessary to consider the effect of an insufficient explanation [ 32]. 
 
Effect of the Minister’s  conceded  breaches on the legality of detention  
 
The appellant argued  that the Minister’s conceded breaches rendered his detention between the third 
and 15th days follow ing his recall unlawful . As to this, t here is no link, le t alone a “direct link” (as is 
required following R (Lumba) and R (Kambadzi)  [34-35]) between the Minister’s wrongful failure for 12 
days to provide the appellant with an adequate explanation for his recall, and the lawfulness of his 
detention during that 12-day period  [39]. Further,  the consequences of the appellant’ s argument would 
be of concern in other similar cases, given the  need to detain restricted patients under the Act  in 
appropriate circumstances  [40]. The Court of Appeal was therefore right to c onclude that the 
conceded breaches did not render  the detention unlawful [ 41]. 
 
Damages  and declaration  
 
The appellant is not entitled to damages for the breach of his common law right to receive an adequate 
explanation for his recall within the time set o ut by the Policy. The breach does not amount to a tort 
and there is nothing to suggest that damages would have been available in an ordinary action against 
the Minister [ 43]. The conclusion  is the same in relation to the violation  of Article 5(2) ECHR ; the 
appellant has failed to establish that the effects of the breach were sufficiently grave [ 46]. As for a  
formal declaration , it would not add anything to the recording of the Minister’s concessions  in the 
Court’s judgment  [46]. 
 
Lord Reed adds some observations in relation to the consequences at common law of the Minister’s 
failure to comply with the Polic y [48-53].

The Supreme Court  allows  Versloot Dredging’s  appeal  by a major ity of 4 to 1, holding that the 
‘fraudulent device’ rule does not apply to collateral lies, which are immaterial to the insured’s right t o 
recover . Lord Sumpt ion gives the  lead judgment. Lord Clarke, Lord  Hughes and Lord Toulson give 
concurring judgments. Lord Mance  gives a dissenting judgment.   
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The common law  has long prohibited  recovery from an  insurer where the  insured’s  claim has been 
fabricated  or dishonestly exaggerated  (“the fraudulent claims rule”). The purpose of the rul e is to deter 
fraud . This appeal concerns the more recent extension of that rule to “fraudulent devices” , i.e. 
“collateral lies” told by the insured to embellish their claim, but  which  are irrelevant because the claim 
is justified  whether the statement was  true or false  [1,9]. 
 
The fraudulent claims rule does not apply to collateral lies . The dishonest  lie is typically  immaterial and 
irrelevant to the  honest  claim : the insur ed gains nothing by telling it , and t he insurer loses nothing if  it 
meets a liabilit y that it has always had [ 23-26]. If a collateral lie is to preclude the claim, it must be 
material. The real test  of materiality  is that a collateral lie  told in the course of making a claim  must at 
least go  to the recoverability of the claim on the tr ue facts as found by the court [35-36]. The test is  
not, as suggested by Mance LJ in The Aegeon  [2003] QB 556 and the Court of Appeal and Lord Mance The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 in this case,  an attenuated test of materiality requiring that the prospects of the claim should apparently 
be improved,  given the facts known  at the time of the lie  [18-22, 31 ].  
 
Lord Clarke concurs, adding that public policy requires that the collateral lie be irrelevant to the 
insured’s claim, and that it would make little sense to support a rule that bars cla ims involving  collateral 
lies uttered before proceedings are begun, and not afterwards [ 39-49]. Lord Hughes ag rees, pointing 
out that this extension of the important fraudulent claims rule has been left open  by the Insurance A ct 
2015 . The forfeiture of the  entire claim is not a proportionate sanction for the teller of a collateral lie , 
who will suffer in other ways if his lie is discovered  [65-104]. Lord Toulson, concurring, concludes that 
this outcome is just and appropriate [ 105-110].  
 
In a dissenting ju dgment, Lord Mance would have dismissed the appeal, upholding the principle  set 
out in The Aegeon , but modifying it so as to require a heightened threshold test of materiality of a 
“significant improve ment of the insured’s prospects”  at the time of the lie  (rather than retrospectively 
at the time that the court determines the facts),  in order to bar the insured’ s claim [ 111-134].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
It seems instinctively un just for a person to suffer injury as a result of the malicious prosecution 
of legal proceedings  for which there is no reasonable ground, and yet not be entitled to 
compensation for the injury intentionally caused by the person responsible for instigating it  [43]. 
The tort will not deter those who have valid claims. This was the argument advanced for not 
allowing  the tort in criminal  proceedings . It has no greater merit in civil proceedings  [44]. There 
is a public interest in finality and in avoiding unnecessa ry satellite litigation, but an action for 
malicious prosecution does not amount to a collateral attack on the outcome  of the first 
proceedings  [46]. The tort does not create a duty of care. There is a great difference between 
imposing a duty of care and i mposing a liability for maliciously instituting proceedings without 
reasonable or probable cause  [49]. Over the last 400 years there has been a volume of case law 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 
 about malice, and the related requirement of absence of reasonable and probable cause, for th e 
purposes of the tort of malicious prosecution [53]. 
 
To make out malicious prosecution it is well established that the requirements of absence of 
reasonable and probable cause and malice are separate requirements although they may be 
entwined. In order to have reasonable and probable cause, the defendant does not have to believe 
that the proceedings will succeed. It is enough that, on the material on which he acted, there was 
a proper case to lay before the court. Malice is an additional requirement. As applied to malicious 
prosecution, it requires the claimant to prove that the defendant deliberately misused the process 
of the court. The most obvious case is where the claimant can prove that the defendant brought 
the proceedings in the knowledge that the y were without foundation. But the authorities show that 
there may be other instances of abuse. A person, for example, may be indifferent whether the 
allegation is supportable and may bring the proceedings, not for the bona fide purpose of trying 
that issu e, but to secure some extraneous benefit to which he has no colour of a right. The critical 
feature which has to be proved is that the proceedings instituted by the defendant were not a bona 
fide use of the court’s process  [54-55]. The combination of requi rements that the claimant must 
prove not only the absence of reasonable and probable cause, but also that the defendant did not 
have a bona fide reason to bring the proceedings, means that the claimant has a heavy burden to 
discharge  [56].  
 
Lord Clarke delivers a concurring judgment by reference to the arrest of ships, the ingredients of 
the tort of misfeasance in public office and the close affinity between malicious prosecution of 
criminal proceedings and malicious prosecution of civil proc eedings [60-91].   
 
Lord Neuberger delivers a dissenting judgment with twelve reasons for why the tort of malicious 
prosecution should not available in respect of civil proceedings  between one private litigant and 
another as well as in criminal proceedings. The key reasons are that the tort would be inconsistent 
with the general rule that a litigant owes no duty to his opponent in the conduct of civil litigation 
[157] , inconsistent with witness immunity  from civil liability [158] , create a danger  of satellite 
litigation  [163] and may have a chilling effect on the bringing  civil proceedings [166] .  
 
Lord Mance delivers a dissenting judgment. The extension of malicious prosecution is not 
supported by the authorities [95-129] or by policy because, for example, there is no duty of care 
owed between litigants [130-140, see 135] .  
 
Lord Sumption adds a dis senting judgment. When recognising new species of non -consensual 
liability, the common law must develop coherently. The recognition of a general liability for 
maliciously prosecuting civil proceedings circumvents the principled limits that the courts have 
imposed on the tort of abuse [178] . Its developments must also be warranted by current values 
and social conditions. The courts have far more extensive powers today than they did a century 
and a half ago to pr event abuse of their procedures  [179] .  
 
Lord R eed adds  a dissenting judgment  in agreement  with Lords  Neuberger and Mance adding 
observations  including a caution against relying on 16th to 18th century cases in a judgment’s 
reasoning, especially when constructing their historical context may be difficult [182-3].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Mr Mirza’s appeal . Mr Patel is entitled to restitution 
of the £620,000 which he paid to Mr Mirza. Lord Toulson (with whom Lady Hale, Lord Kerr, 
Lord Wilson and Lord Hodge agree ) gives  the lead judgment.  Lord Neuberge r, Lord Mance, Lord 
Clarke and Lord Sumption concur in the result, but by different processes of reasoning.   
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Mansfield  said in Holman v Johnson  (1775) 1 Cowp 341, 343 that “no court will lend its aid to a 
man who founds his  cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act ” [1]. Behind this maxim , there are two 
broad policy reasons for the common law doctrine of illegality as a defence to a civil claim. First, 
a person should not be allowed to profit from his own wrongdoing. Second, the law should be 
coherent and not self -defeating, condoning illegality by giving with the left hand what it takes with 
the right hand [99]. The reliance test expressed in Tinsley  v Milligan [1994] 1 AC 340  bars the 
claimant if he/she relies on the illegality in order to bring the claim. This test has been criticised 
and Tinsley should no longer be followed [110] . 
 
The essential rationale of the illegality doctrine , as explained by the Supreme Court of Canada in 
Hall v Hebert [1993] 3 RCS 159, is that it would be contrary to the public interest to enforce a 
claim if to do so would be harmful to the integrity of the legal system. In assessing whether the 
public inter est would be harmed in that way, it is necessary to consider a) the underlying purpose 
of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enha nced by 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 denial of the claim, b)  any other relevant public policy on which the denial of the claim may have 
an impact and c)  whether denial of the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality . 
Various  factors may be relevant, but the court is not free to decide a case in an undisciplined way. 
The public interest is best served by a principled and transparent assessment of the considerations 
identified, rather by than the application of a formal approach capable of producing results which 
may appear arbitr ary, unjust or disproportionate  [120] . 
 
In considering whether it would be disproportionate to refuse relief to which the claimant would 
otherwise be entitled, as a matter of public policy, various factors may be relevant. Potentially 
relevant factors include the seriousness of the conduct, its centrality to the contract, whether it was 
intentional and whether there was marked disparity in the parties’ respective culpability  [107] . 
 
A claimant, such as Mr Patel, who satisfies the ordinary requirements of a claim for unjust 
enrichment, should not be debarred from enforcing his claim by reason only of the fact that the 
money which he seeks to recover was paid for an unlawful purpose. There may be rare cases where 
for some particular reason the enforcement of such a claim might be regarded as undermi ning the 
integrity of the justice system, but there are no such circumstances in this case  [121] . 
 
Lord Kerr writes a concurring judgment elaborating on aspects of Lord Toulson’s judgment. Lord 
Kerr identifies that there is a choice of approaches between a  rule-based approach on the one hand 
and on the other a more flexible approach, taking into account the policy considerations that are 
said to favour recognising the defence of illegality [133] . A rule -based approach to the question 
has failed to lead to the predictability it sought . Further, it is questionable whether particular weight 
should be given to  predictability where a claimant and defendant have been parties to an illegal 
agreement  [137] . 
 
Lord Neuberger  [143, 163] , Lord Mance  [197-199], Lord Cla rke [210] and Lord Sumption [250, 
253] all conclude there is no inconsistency in the law in permitting a party to an illegal arrangement 
to recover any sum paid under it, so long as restitution is possible. An order for restitution simply 
returns the parti es to the positon in which they would and should have been, had no such illegal 
arrangement been made .  
 
Lord Neuberger goes on however to express the further  view that, in relation to other issues 
involving illegal arrangements, the approach suggested by Lord Toulson provides as reliable and 
helpful guidance as it is possible to give  [174, 186] .  
 
Lord Mance, Lord Clarke and Lord Sumption, in separate judgments expressing general agreement 
with each other, consider that , with the above clarification of the operation of restitution, there is  
no basis for substituting for the clear -cut principle identified in Holman v Johnson and Hall v 
Hebert, founded on the need to maintain the integrity of the law, a mix of factors as a dvocated by 
Lord Toulson, which would not offer the same coherence or certainty  [206-207, 216 -219 and 259 -
265].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows Amoena (UK) Limited’s  appeal . Lord Carnwath gives the 
judgment of the court, with which the other Justic es agree.    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The factual findings of the First -tier Tribunal concerning the design features of the Carmen bra are not 
in dispute [3]. The issue is whether the bra falls under heading 9021 of chapter 90 of the CN 
classification sys tem, which takes effect under EU Regulation 2658/87 [7]. As the Court of Justice of 
the European Union  (“CJEU”)  held in the Uroplasty  case (C -514/04), the intended use of the produc t 
may constitute an objective criterion in relation to tariff classificatio n if it is inherent in the product 
and is capable of assessment on the basis of the products objective characteristics [10].  
 
The Court of Appeal conclu ded with respect to “orthopaedic appliances” that the reference in 
explanatory note 6 to appliances “su pporting or holding parts of the body following an illness, 
operation or injury” d oes not encompass appliances supporting  artificial  body parts such as an artificial 
breast form . Lord Carnwath observes, without ruling decisively on the issue, that the Cour t of Appeal’s 
conclusion  is consistent with the ordinary understanding of orthopaedics and the Advocate General’s 
opinion in the Uroplasty case [22-24].  
 
Under the sub-heading “appliance to compensate for a defect or disability”, Lord Carnwath agrees 
with the Court of Appeal that it is the breast form  which compensate s for the defect or disability, and 
the bra is worn solely to keep it in place [26-28]. 
 
 
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
 
The final sub -heading considered is “artificial parts of the body”. The issue is whether, under not e 
2(b), the bra is a “part” or “accessory” and “suitable for use solely or principally with” the breast form, 
and so should be “classified with” it [29]. This point was answered in favour of the Appellant by the 
Upper Tribunal [31] but reversed by the Cour t of Appeal, based on its interpretation of t hree CJEU 
cases, Turbon 1  (C-276/00) , Turbon 2  (C-250/05) , and Unomedical  (C-152/10)  [33-36]. The two Turbon  
cases, which dealt with ink -cartridges for printers, are of little direct help on account of having su ch 
different facts , but they provide guidance on the meaning of “parts and accessories” , which was treated 
as authoritative in Unomedical [38]. There are difficulties in the reasoning of the CJEU  in defining 
“accessories” , and in the Advocate General’s sug gestion in Turbon 2 that “additional functionality ” is 
required . A better answer is that the second test identified in Turbon 1, whether the item performs “a 
particular  service relative to the  main function” , should be narrowly construed as referring to a service 
directly connected with the mechanisms or processes by which that function  is performed  [41]. 
  
Unomedical , which concerned urine drainage bags , is of more direct relevance to the interpretation of 
heading 9021. What mattered to the CJEU in that ca se was that the bags played no direct part in the 
actual processes of either the catheter or the dialyser  [42]. However, the reasoning of the CJEU  in 
these three cases  is difficult to translate to an artificial breast form, whose function does not depend o n 
any mechanical or other active process  [43].  
 
In agreement with the Court of Appeal , Lord Carnwath does not consider the bra to be a “part” either 
of the breast form on its own, or of a “whole” consisting of the breast form and bra together, as it is 
marketed as an entirely separate product [44]. However, on a natural reading  of the guidance , the bra 
is an “accessory”  because it enables the breast form to perform its function, by holding it in place , and 
thus performs “a particular service relative to (i ts) main function”  [45].

The S upreme Court unanimously allows Mr Kumarasamy’s appeal . Lord Neuberger gives the leading 
judgment, with which the other Justices agree.  Lord Carnwath also gives a short judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
This appeal raises three questions , all of which m ust be answered in the affirmative for Mr Edwards to 
succeed on the appeal  [14-16]: 
 
(1) Whether , in the light of the wording of sections 11(1)(a) and 11(1A)(a)  of the 1985 Act , the paved 
area can be described as part of the exterior of the front hall;  
(2) Whether Mr Kumarasamy had an “estate or interest” in the front hall for the  purposes of section 
11(1A)(a);  
The Supreme Court  of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 (3) Whether Mr Kumarasamy could be liable to Mr Edwards for the disrepair in question 
notwithstanding that he had had no notice of the disrepair in the paved ar ea before Mr Edwards’ 
accident.  
 
Section 11(1) of the 1985 Act , which  implies into certain leases of dwelling -houses a covenant by the 
landlord to keep in repair the structure and exterior of the dwelling -house , applies to the Subtenancy . 
Where the dwellin g-house only forms part of a building, section 11(1A) provides that the covenant has 
effect in relation to any part of the building in which the lessor has an estate or interest [6]. It is not 
possible, as a matter of ordinary language, to describe a path leading from a car park to the entrance 
door of a building as part of the exterior of the front hall  of that building  [17]. Such a  wide reading 
would be difficult to reconcile with the wording of section 11(1A)(a) , particularly the limitation to “the 
build ing”, and the specific extension to cover “drains, gutters and external pipes” , which supports a 
natural reading of the term “exterior” [18].  
 
As to the second question, Mr Kumarasamy was granted a right of way over the front hall and, as a 
matter of prop erty law, a right of way over land constitutes an interest in that land [23]. The argument 
that Mr Kumarasamy cannot be said to have interest in the front hall since the Subtenancy had effectively 
deprived Mr Kumarasamy of any practical benefit in the ease ment so long as it continued is rejected [24-
25].  
 
As to the third question , there is an established rule that a landlord is not liable to repair premises which 
are in the possession of the tenant and not of the landlord, unless and until the landlord has  notice of 
the disrepair  (“the rule”)  [30]. Where a landlord agrees to repair the structure and exterior of a flat, the 
rule would apply but only to the extent that the structure is included in the demise and the tenant is 
accordingly in possession of that  part of the structure [39-40].  
 
The subsequent question is whether the rule can be invoked when a landlord has covenanted with a 
tenant to repair the structure but is not in possession of the structure, for example because he has let it 
to another tenant  [41]. In such a case, the landlord is not normally entitled to notice in such 
circumstances [42-42]. The rule only applies to property in the possession of the tenant [43].  
 
In view of this analysis, Mr Kumarasamy ’s submission that, in every case where a tenant relies on a 
covenant implied by section 11, a landlord could not be liable until they had notice  of the disrepair , even 
where the landlord is undoubtedly in possession of the property,  is rejected [44-46].  
 
The present case is concerned with the application of a landlord’s repairing covenant to property which 
is not in the possession of either the landlord or the tenant. The application of the reasoning upon which 
the rule is based justifies the conclusion that  the landlord’s obligation to repair the paved area is only 
triggered once he has notice of any disrepair for which the tenant would seek to make him liable [49]. 
While it is true that Mr Kumarasamy has the right to use the common parts as against the freeholder, he 
has effectively lost that right for the duration of the Subtenancy to the tenant , Mr Edwards  [50]. It is 
true that the tenant does not enjoy exclusive possession of the common parts, but he is present on them 
every time he comes to or leaves the flat [50] and has the best means of knowing of any want of repair 
in them  [52].

Following a hearing at which the Court heard argument on the ultra vires issue and indicated that it  did 
not need to hear argument on the discrimination issue, t he Supreme Court unanimously allows the The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom

 Public Law Project’s  appeal  on the ultra vires  issue. Lord Neuberger gives the only judgment, with 
which the other Justices agree.     
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDG MENT  
 
The Public Law Project contend that the exclusion of a specific group of people from the right to 
receive legal services on the ground of personal circumstances or characteristics , which have nothing 
to do with the nature of the issue or services inv olved or the individual’s need, or ability to pay, for the 
services , is not within the scope of the power accorded to the Lord Chancellor by section 9(2)(b) of 
LASPO, and that nothing in section 41 undermines that contention.  
 
That argument is accepted by the Court [30]. In declaring subordinate legislation to be outside the 
scope of the statutory power pursuant to which it was purportedly made, the Court is upholding the 
supremacy of Parliament over the Executive [23]. Section 9(2)(b) provides a power to v ary or omit 
services, but the relevant parts of the draft order do not seek to vary or omit services; rather, they seek 
to reduce the class of individuals who are entitled to receive those services by reference to a personal 
characteristics or circumstance  unrelated to the services  (i.e. length of residency)  [30].  
 
This interpretation of the wording of section 9(2) is supported by the wider statutory context. Each of 
the services identified in Part 1 and Part 2 of Schedule 1 is linked to a specific type of  legal issue or 
claim, and has nothing to do with the personal circumstances or characteristics  – in particular the 
geographical residence  – of the potential recipient of the services [31].  
 
This conclusion is also supported by contrasting the wording of the two subsections of section 9. 
Subsection (1) clearly distinguishes between the question of whether the particular services qualify and 
whether the particular individual qualifies [33]. Section 9(2) is concerned with the services which 
qualify, and it i s section 11 which appears to be concerned with identifying the characteristics or 
circumstances of individuals who are to qualify for civil legal aid . The criteria that section 11 sets out 
all relate to the issue involved, the services concerned, or the n eed of the individual for financial 
assistance , in contrast to the draft order . This indicates  that the draft order is attempting to do 
something which the legislature never had in mind when enacting section 9  [34].  
 
The Court of Appeal concluded that sec tion 41 could be invoked to defeat the contention that the 
Lord Chancellor could not make the draft order under section 9 . While it is true that section 41(2)(b) 
permits any order made under section 9(2)(b) to “make provision by reference to… services prov ided 
for a particular class of individual” , this cannot extend the power under section 9(2)(b)  so as  to exclude 
a whole cla ss of individuals from the scope  of Part 1 of LASPO by reference to their residence [36]. 
Section 41 is clearly intended to grant ancillary powers to those primarily granted under section 9 [36]. 
 
Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed on the first, ultra vires, issue, and the Court does not  have to  
deal with the discrimination issue [39].

The Suprem e Court dismisses  Mr Campbell’s appeal  by a majority of three to two. Lord Carnwath 
gives the majority judgment, with which Lord Mance and Lord Reed agree. Lord Toulson gives a 
dissenting judgment, with which Lady Hale agrees  in a separate dissent . 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Carnwath holds that there is no authority for the proposition that a person can be made 
indirectly liable for breach of an obligation imposed by statute on someone else, and that it is only 
possible to pierce the corporate veil  to impose liability on a director or other individual through whom 
the company acts, if  it is expressly or impliedly justified by the statute [13]. In section 5 of the 1969 
Act, Parliament has imposed a specific and closely defined criminal penalty  on a d irector bearing 
responsibility for a failure to insure, which is linked to the criminal liability of the company [14]. Lord 
Carnwath finds that in determining statutory liability, the court must pay due respect to the language 
and structure of the statute,  rather than to preconceptions as to what its objectives could or should 
have been [18]. He rejects the argument that the imposition of criminal liability is sufficient to ren der 
the director civilly liable, finding that other statutory provisions imposing  criminal liability on directors 
for offences by their companies have not been treated as giving rise to civil liability [21-2]. He finds 
that the language in section 5 of the 1969 Act was deliberately chosen and is specifically directed at 
criminal liabil ity, and accordingly it is difficult to infer an intention to impose a more general liability 
[23].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
 
Lord Toulson would have allowed the appeal, finding that the effect in substance of section 5 of the 
1969 Act is to place a legal obligation on a dire ctor or other officer of a company not to cause or 
permit the company to be without the required insurance, on pain of a criminal penalty. He considers 
that t he imposition of criminal responsibility  for a specified act (or omission)  carries with it a legal  
obligation not to act (or omit to act) in such a way [26]. Lord Toulson prefers a functional approach to 
interpreting the legislation which looks to the objective of the statute, which is employee protection 
[30]. However, even on a formalist approach, th e director is in law guilty as a principal of failing to 
insure [31]. Since the Victorian age, the courts have held that breaches of legislation for the protection 
of employees are actionable at common law  by the  employee suffering the breach [32]. If the 
legislation is silent on whether there should be civil liability, the judges’ role is to fill the gaps [34]. 
Where legislation is passed to protect employees, a breach will ordinarily give rise to a cause of action, 
absent a clear statutory intention to th e contrary [41].  
 
Lady Hale agrees with Lord Toulson and would have allowed the appeal. Lady Hale considers it 
absolutely clear that in enacting the 1969 Act, Parliament did intend that failure to insure should give 
rise not only to criminal liability but  also to civil liability towards an employee who had been injured by 
his employer’s breach of duty and who, because of the failure to insure, would not otherwise receive 
the compensation for his injuries to which he was entitled [43]. She stresses that, co ntrary to the view 
expressed by the Inner House, the law has not been changed by recent House of Lords and Supreme 
Court decisions.

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Secretary of State’ s appeal and dismisses  the application 
for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision. Lord Kerr gives the only judgment.  
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Secretary of State contended that service of a foreign judgment could not engage article 6 because 
(1) it does not have the direct consequence of exposing the individual to a breach of any fair trial 
guarantee and (2) the consequences of service are not of a type or nature to warrant the engagement of 
article 6 rights  [13]. Further, the Secretary of State submitted tha t it was not incumbent on her to 
investigate the fairness of proceedings in a foreign state when she was asked to serve a judgment: that 
would run counter to the purpose of the 2003 Act which was to provide speedy and effective procedural 
assistance to oth er sovereign states [15]. For Mr Ismail , it was  submitted that there is a clear discretion 
in the 2003 Act ; that the Secretary of State is required to carefully assess the respondent’s representations 
on article 6 when plausible  evidence of unfairness in the Egyptian trial was provided to her ; and that 
service is more than a merely administrative act [18, 20 ]. 
 
From a purely textual perspective, the wording of the statute suggests an administrative procedure that 
does not routine ly require examination of the proceedings which prompted the request for service [23]. 
On the other hand, the Act provides a power and not an obligation to effect service of foreign process 
and it was therefore contemplated that there would be  circumstance s in which service would not be 
appropriate [26]. 
 
It is well settled that a person physically present in a country which has acceded to the ECHR is entitled 
to its protection, even in circumstances where the actions of a member state would expose them to 
consequences in a non -contracting foreign state which would amount to a violation of Convention rights 
[32]. That, however, is not the context  of this case because the decision of the Secretary of State to serve 
the judgment on Mr Ismail did not expose him  to a risk of violation of his Convention rights [36]. 
Service of the judgment would have undoubtedly placed Mr Ismail in a dilemma – whether to return to 
Egypt to appeal the judgment, or suffer the consequences of the judgment becoming  final – but having 
to face that dilemma does not amount to a possible violation of his article 6 rights [36]. Service of the 
Egyptian judgment does not have a direct consequence of exposing Mr Ismail to “proscribed ill -
treatment”. It reduces his options but does not carry th e inevitable outcome of exposure to a violation 
of his rights. He could avoid that exposure by remaining in the UK [38]. 
 
Service of a judgment is not the same as enforcement of it because it does not give legal force to the 
judgment or ratify it [41]. Service does not, therefore, alter the legal position of the person on whom it 
is served. It may narrow the legal options available to him but his essential legal position remains 
unchanged [42]. Service of the judgment would not involve an exercise of t he UK’s sovereignty  nor 
would it engage Mr Ismail’s fundamental rights. Indeed, in the particular circumstances of this case, it 
would have no material impact on Mr Ismail at all [48]. The Secretary of State was under no obligation 
to investigate further t he consequences that would accrue to Mr Ismail on service of the judgment [52]. 
 
That being said, there may be cases in which service of a judgment would  engage article 6 or would call 
for further investigation of the basis on which the judgment had been obtained. That might occur, for 
instance, where service would lead more directly to enforcement or  have other material consequences 
on the individual. In certain cases service of a foreign judgment might engage article 6. This is not such 
a case [53].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Mance gives the leading  judgment, with

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Although the EU Framework Decision , on which the provisions of section 2 of the Extradition Act 
2003 are based , does not explicitly distinguish between accusation and conviction cases, in practice there 
are significant differences in the bases on which EAWs in each category of case will rest [23-24]. In an 
accusation case, an EAW will normally be based on a domestic arrest warrant whereas in a con viction 
case, the natural basis of an EAW will be an enforceable judgment [25-26]. Where there exists an 
enforceable judgment, there is no reason why there should necessarily be any domestic warrant and, if 
there is, there is no obvious reason why it shoul d be required to be evidenced in the EAW [26]. 
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 A domestic warrant may be required in a conviction case where a person is at large when convicted, has 
absconded, and is wanted for sentencing , and might in such circumstances be regarded as constituting 
the basis of any EAW issued to secure his surrender for sentencing [27]. But, where a person has been 
sentenced to an immediate sentence of imprisonment and is due to be in prison but has absconded, 
there is no obvious reason why there should be any domestic w arrant at all or why, if there is one, it 
should be required to be evidenced in any EAW issued to secure the offender’s return to serve his 
sentence [29]. 
 
The circumstances of the present appeals involve sentence s of imprisonment which did not take 
immedi ate effect. Only the first and third EAWs issued in relation to Mr Sas are presently relevant. As 
regards  the conviction the subject of the first EAW , Mr Sas was free until he lost his appeal, whereupon 
he was summonsed to report to detention, which he failed to do . A court order later issued to secure his 
attendance was irrelevant to the enforceability of the sentence, and could not constitute a warrant for 
the purposes of section 2(6)(c) , and did not therefore need to be particularised in the EAW [31].  
 
As regards  the conviction the subject of the third EAW  relating to Mr Sas , Mr Sas  was given an 
immediate sentence of imprisonment but granted conditional release which was revoked when he 
breached the conditions of his release. When he failed to surrender,  a domestic warrant was issued for 
his arrest [33]. As regards the conviction the subject of the EAW relating to Mr Goluchowski , the 
sentences of imprisonment passed were suspended , but ordered by the court to be serve d when he broke 
certain conditions. In  these circumstances, both Appellants were due to attend prison without more as 
a result of court orders, and only when they failed to obey those orders were any domestic court orders, 
summonses or warrants issued to secure attendance at the relevant corre ction facility [32]. Those 
summonses or warrants are therefore irrelevant to the EAW s, did not need mentioning  in them and did 
not constitute warrants under section 2(6)(c) of the 2003 Act [34]. 
 
It was not necessary for the EAWs to contain e vidence of  the decisions resulting in suspension of Mr 
Goluchowski’s original sentence and subsequent activation of it, nor of Mr Sas’s conditional release and 
the subsequent revocation of that  [35, 42-44]. On the face of the EAWs, details are given of judgments 
which by themselves required the Appellants to begin immediate service of a sentence  [36]. Though 
they do not contain details of every judicial decision by virtue of which the sentence has become 
enforceable, to require such details would (i) mean that an EAW should set out a quite complex history 
of proceedings whereas box (b) of the prescribed form of EAW contemplates a single reference, (ii) run 
counter to principles of mutual confidence on which t he EAW regime is based, and (iii) overlook the 
fact that it is always open to an executing state to request more information from the requesting state, 
as the UK seems to have done in these cases [43]. But a  final decision on the exten t of the details 
required is un necessary since the processes by which the judgments became enforceable is clear from 
the subsequently obtained information, and EU caselaw establishes that an otherwise valid EAW is not 
to be treated as invalid or ineffective merely because the full history is not contained in the EAW itself 
[44]. Even if a reference to the activating  decisions should, strictly speaking, have been made in the 
EAWs alongside the reference to the judgment as enforceable, this cannot mean, under European law 
or the Extradition Act 2003, that the EAWs should be treated as incapable of being executed [45].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGME NT 
 
The Supreme Court has inherent jurisdiction to correct injustice caused by an unfair procedure which 
leads to an earlier judgment  or is revealed by the discovery of fresh evidence , although a judgment cannot 
be set aside just because  it is thought to have been wrong on points unrelated to such procedure or 
evidence [5, 154, 190]. The authorities indicate as the threshold for setting aside a previous judgment 
whether a significant injustice has “probably occurred ” in case of non -disclosure or whether there is a 
“powerful probability” of significant injustice in case of fresh evidence. But Lord Mance le aves open the 
possibility of the egregiousness of the procedural breach and/or the difficulty of assessing its 
consequences militat ing in favour  of a lower threshold , and considers the application on that basis  too 
[8]. An applicant must also show that there is no alternative effective remedy [6].  
 
As to the non-disclosure , the essential questions  are (i) whether due disclosure of the Rashid docu ments 
would have led to a challenge by Mr Bancoult’s representatives to the 2B report in the original judicial 
review proceedings, and, if so, (ii) whether it is likely that such a challenge would have resulted in a 
different outcome to the 2008 judgment  [61].   
 
Assuming without deciding that  (i) was satisfied,  Lord Mance concludes as to (ii), after review ing the 
2008 judgment [16-19] and the Rashid documents [20-64], that t here is no probability, likelihood, 
prospect or real possibility that a court woul d have seen , or would now see, anything which could, would 
or should have caused the respondent  to doubt the conclusions  of the 2B report , or made it irrational 
or otherwise unjustifiable to act on them in June 2004  [65]. As to the alleged new evidence , the first 
head consists essentially of analysis and submissions which the majority takes into account, the second 
and third heads consist of material outside the respondent’s knowledge at the relevant times and neither 
they nor the fourth provide any basis  for setting aside the 2008 judgment [66-71].  
 
Even if the  threshold for setting aside were crossed , circumstances have changed in the light of the 2014 -
15 study  and/or governmental confirmation that the M PA does not preclude resettlement [72-75]. It is 
now open to any Chagossian to mount a fresh challenge to the failure to abrogate the 2004 orders in t he 
light of the 2014 -15 study’s findings, as an alternative to further lengthy litigation  and quite possibly a 
fresh first instance hearing about the factu ally superseded 2B report. [72-76, 78 -79].  
 
Lord Kerr, with whom Lady Hale agrees , would have set aside the 2008 Decision. Although the appellant 
accepted that it must be shown that the non -disclosure probably had, or may well have had, a decisive 
effect on the outcome  [155] , Lord Kerr would have held that it is enough for there to be  a real possibility 
that a different outcome would have occurred had the information been available at the time of the 
original hearing  [160-163]. The Rashid documents might well have caused the 2008 Decision to be 
different [168, 193 ]. Lord Kerr disagrees with the majority that the conclusions of the 2014 -2015 
feasibility study render the present application moot . The mere possibility that the Chagos sians might 
be allowed to resettle  is insufficient. I t would be necessary to demonstrate that they would achieve the 
same result  as would accrue on the successful re -opening of the appeal  [179] .  Moreover, there is no 
question of pragmatic justice being do ne here as t he Supreme Court in this app eal is unable to vindicate 
the a ppellant’s right to resettle in the BIOT  [180] .

The Supreme Court unanimously rules that it does not have jurisdiction to hear the father’s appeal , 
which must therefore be struck out . Lady Hale gives the only substantive judgment .    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Under s 40 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 , appeals to the Supreme Court are subject to 
provision under any other enactment restricting such an appeal. The question therefore is whether the 
provisions of BIIR constitute such an enactment or otherwis e override the jurisdiction granted to the 
Supreme Court by s 40 [ 12]. 
 
The application to regist er a judgment governed by BIIR is intended to be a speedy and essentially 
administrative process. Either party may appeal the decision under article 33, which is subject to the 
provision in article 34 that the judgment given on such an appeal may be contested only by the 
proceedings referred to in the list notified by each member state to the Commission pursuant to article 
68. The UK has provided in its list of notifica tions under article 68 that  appeals in England and Wales The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 under article 34 may be brought only by a single further appeal  on a point of law to the Court of 
Appeal [ 16]. 
 
It has been the practice of the UK in several previous European instruments con cerned with the free 
movement of judgments and judicial cooperation to provide for only one tier of further appeal. The 
purpose of this restriction is to further the intention of these instruments that  member states should 
recognise  and enforce each other’ s judgments  without too many avenues for challenge [ 26].  
 
The provisions of BIIR and the notification under article 68 are directly applicable in the UK. Article 
34 does not depend for its implementation upon the member state’s choice of avenue of appeal and in 
any event the UK did make a notification [ 37]. It is not necessary for the notification to reflect all 
appellate rights under UK law : to further the objective of BIIR, article 68 permits member states to 
make notifications which cut down the routes of appeal which would otherwise be available [ 38]. 
 
It follows that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal in this case and the appeal 
is struck out.

Lord Hughes identifies  four possible  readings of s83: [10] 
1) any grant(s) of leave to r emain totalling more than 12 months bring the claimant within the 
section, whenever they occurred and whether or not they had expired before the asylum claim 
was made and determined ; 
2) grant(s) of leave to remain totalling more than 12 months bring the claim ant within the section 
providing such leave is still current at the time of the de termination of the asylum claim ; The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 3) grant(s) of leave to remain bring the claimant within the section providing that such leave 
totalled more than 12 months counting from the da te of refusal or later grant, and whether the 
grant(s) were made before or after refusal . 
4) grant(s) of leave to remain totalling more than 12 months bring the claimant within the section 
if but only if they (and all of them if more than one) are either cont emporaneous with or post -
date the determination of the asylum claim; this was the Secretary of State’s primary case and 
was adopted by the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal.  
 
Lord Hughes notes that whilst s83 can be read as a matter of language  a numb er of ways, some are 
more natural than others.  In particular, s 83 appears to focus on the time when the asylum claim has 
been rejected, for it is concerned with appeals against this decision, and then to ask whether, when a 
claimant wishes to appeal, the c ondition in subsection 1(b) is met.  [14] 
 
The purpose of s83 is tolerably clear. It is to provide an additional and more targeted right of appeal 
beyond the ordinary one created by s82. It is to provide a vehicle for the determination by the tribunal 
of re fugee status, when that status is asserted but rejected by the Secretary of State, in those cases 
where no such vehicle otherwise exists, nor will exist within a reasonable time.  s83 was designed to 
create  an extra  right of appeal for those who have a longer period of leave to remain  and who would 
otherwise  have no s82 vehicle  which they could use. The intention was that those in this situation  
should not be deprived of the right to challenge the refusal of their asylum claim where that refusal is 
not accom panied by a decision to remove them . [21] 
 
Once  this is understood , it is clear that the construction which most neat ly serves the purpose  of the 
statute is  interpretation  “3”, i.e. that grant s of leave to remain bring the claimant within the section 
provi ding that such leave totalled more than 12 months counting from the date of refusal or lat er 
grant, and whether the grants were made before or after refusal.  [22]

The Supreme Court unanimously grants permission to appeal to Ms Onu but dismisses both Ms Taiwo 
and Ms Onu’s appeal s. It holds  that neither appellant has  suffered race discrimination because the 
reason  for their abuse  by the respondents was not nationality but their vulnerability as a particular kind 
of migrant worker . Lady Ha le gives the only substantive judgment.  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Under s 13(1) Equality Act 2010  (‘EA’)  a person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a 
protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or would treat oth ers. Race is a 
protected characteristic and includes colour, nationality and ethnic origins  [13]. There is no doubt in 
these cases that the  appellants  were treated disgracefully by their employers in a way which employees 
who did not share the appellants’ vulnerable immigration status would not ha ve been treated. The 
question i s whether discrimination on grounds of immigration status amounts to discrimination on 
grounds of nationality [ 14]. 
 
Generally speaking employ ers are free to choose  whom to employ , subject to the limits under the EA 
(and earlier legislation) to protect specified groups , who have historically suffered discrimination , from 
being shut out of access to employment for irrelevant reasons which they can do nothing about  [21]. 
Parliament could  have chosen to include immigration status in the list of protected characteristics but 
it did not do so  [22]. Immigration status is a function of nationality in that non -British nationals (other 
than Irish citizens ) are subject to immigration control, but  there is a wide variety of immigration 
statuses  [23]. The appellants were particularly vulnerable to the abuse they suffered because of the 
terms of their domestic workers’ visas  which meant they were dependent on their current employers 
for their continu ed right to live and work in the UK [ 24]. But there are many non -British nationals 
living and working in the UK who do not share this vulnerability and would not have been abused  in 
the same way. The treatment of the appellants had nothing to do w ith the f act they were Nigerian  and 
they were not  the subject of direct discrimination  [26]. 
 
This was not a case of indirect discrimination. There was no ‘provision, criterion or practice’ as defined 
in s 19 EA applied by the respondents to all their employees reg ardless of their immigration status [ 32].  
 
The present law does not therefore offer redress for all the harm suffered by the appellants. Parliament 
might wish to consider extending the remedy  available under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 to give 
employment tribunals jurisdiction to grant compensation for ill -treatment meted out to workers [ 34].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  Stonegale  and Mr Pelosi junior ’s appeal . Lord Reed gives 
the judg ment, with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Reed finds that the Appellant s’ submission  that the administrators could have pursued a number 
of alternative remedies is not relevant to the issue which this court must determine, which is  whether 
the Respondents are entitled to the remedy they have sought on the basis that the four dispositions are 
gratuitous alienations  [17]. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
Lord Reed holds that the gratuitous nature of the alienations was clearly explained by the Lord 
Ordinary  and is plain and obvious . Prior to the conveyances, the companies owned five properties : 
110, 210, 260 and 278 Glasgow Road, and 64 Roslea Drive. The Anglo -Irish Bank (“the bank”) held 
standard securities over each of these five properties , having made ava ilable to Oceancrown a secured 
facility in the region of 17.3 million, which was cross -guaranteed by the other two companies  [4].  
 
In August 2010 the bank’s solicitors were informed by Mr Robert Frame, a solicitor of Miller Becket 
and Jackson  (“MBJ”) , of the “details of the properties and the relevant sale price” in relation to the 
release of the five properties from the ban k’s securities. The bank’s solicitors were informed that the 
sale prices were as follows: £762,000 for 278 Glasgow Road; £200,000 for 110 Glasgow Road; 
£934,000 for 210 Glasgow Road; £450,000 for 260 Glasgow Road. They were also informed that 64 
Roslea Drive was to be sold for £68,000, bringing the total sale price of the five properties to 
£2,414,000. This information was passed to the bank [6].  
 
On 10 November 2010 the property at 278 Glasgow Road was disponed by Oceancrown  for £762,000 
to a company called Strathcroft Ltd, which was also owned by Mr Pelosi senior. On the same day,  
Strathcroft  disponed the same property to Clyde Gateway  for £2,467,500 , a sum far in excess of an 
earlier valuation of £762,000. The Lord Ordinary found that Strathcroft’s involvement was to “provide 
a short -lived intermediary between Oceancrown and Clyde Gateway”, describing it as “a cog in Mr 
Pelosi’s machin e” [7]. No sales had been agreed in respect of the other four properties  [6]. 
 
Strathcroft , on the instructions of Mr Pelosi senior,  authorised MBJ to send the bank the sum of 
£2,414,000 “in respect of purchases of [the five properties]” on 16 November 201 0, and Mr Frame 
transmitted the money to the bank. The bank then executed discharges  of the standard securities over 
all five properties.  The Lord Ordinary found that “the bank was misled in relation to the funds it 
received”  and that had it known that onl y 278 Glasgow Road was sold,  whilst the overall reduction in 
bank indebtedness would have occurred, the bank  would only have discharged the standard security 
over that property  [8].  
 
As a consequence of misleading the bank, Mr Pelosi senior’s  companies re tained the other four 
properties  valued at £1.525 million , free of the bank’s standard securities [9]. On 24 November 2010, 
110, 210 and 260 Glasgow Road were disponed to Stonegale Ltd and 64 Roslea Drive was disponed to 
Mr Pelosi junior. Nothing was paid for these properties [10].  
 
A loan agreement between Strathcrof t Ltd and Stonegale Ltd  signed by Mr Pelosi junior and dated 16 
November 2010  which  purported to enable the latter to finance the purchase of the properties at 110,  
210 and 260 Glasgow Road  was found by the Lord Ordinary to be a sham, “concocted purely for the 
purpose of the defence of these proceedings” [11].   
 
Lord Reed finds that t here was no reciprocity between  the disposal of the four properties , which were 
gifted to Stonegale Ltd  and Mr Pelosi junior , and the earlier payment to the bank. The transactions had 
the purpose and effect of diverting assets from the companies’ creditors , which was exactly what 
section 242 of the Insolvency Act 1986 is intended to prevent [17].

The Supreme Court dismisse s BNY Mellon’s  appeal  by a 3:2 majority . Lord Neuberger gives the 
leading  judgment, with which Lord Mance and Lord Toulson agree . Lord Sumption gives a short 
dissenting judgment, with which Lord Clarke agrees.     
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Trust Deed  cannot be understood unless one has some appreciation of the regulat ory policy of 
the FSA at and before the time that the ECNs were issued [33]. Thus, the general thrust and effect of 
the FSA regulatory material published in 2008 and 2009 can be taken into account when interpreting 
the T&Cs [33].  
 
BNY Mellon argued that t he December 2014 stress test was not “in respect of  Consolidated Core Tier 
1 ratio ” as specified in clause 19(2) of the T&Cs as CT1 had by this point been replaced by CET1 
Capital [27]. This argument is rejected [35]. The reference to “the Consolidated Cor e Tier 1  Ratio ” 
should, in the events which have happened, be treated as a reference to its then regulatory equivalent, 
being Common Equity Tier 1 Capital  [35].   
 
BNY Mellon’s second argument is that, in order for  it to be said that  the ECNs had not  been taken 
into account, they must be disallowed in principle from being taken into account for the purposes of 
the Tier 1 ratio [27, 40] . The question is whether it is sufficient that the ECNs  continue to be taken 
into account for some purpose in the stress -test, or whether they must play a part in enabling LBG to 
pass that test, which they no longer do [40-42]. 
 
The preferable view is that the ECNs must play a part in enabling LBG to pass the stress -test [45]. 
Under the Regulations  passed in 2013, the ECNs cannot be taken into account so as to do the very job 
for which their convertibility was designed, namely to enable them to be converted before the 
regulatory minimum Tier 1 ratio is reached [45]. This conclusion is also supported by the contrast 
between “cea sed to be taken into account”, the expression in clause 19(2), and a different expression, 
“no longer eligible to qualify”, which is in clause 19(1) [46]. Further, if the contrary view were correct, 
it is very difficult to envisage circumstances in which i t could have been thought that clause 19 (2) 
could have been invoked  [47]. Accordingly, the Trustee’s appeal should be dismissed, on the basis that 
a CDE has arisen under clause 19(2) [54]. 
 
Lord Sumption , with whom Lord Clarke agrees,  dissents  on this poin t and considers that the ECNs 
are not redeemable because, notwithstanding their status as lower tier capital, they would be treated by 
the regulator as top -tier capital in the hypothetical event that LBG’s affairs deteriorated to the point 
where the conver sion trigger was attained [55-62].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisse s Fiona McDonald’s appeal . Lord Neuberger and Lady Hale 
give the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.     
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
This appeal raises three qu estions  [1]:  
(i) whether a court, when entertaining a claim for possession by a private sector owner 
against a residential occupier, should, in light of section 6 of the Human Rights Act The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square Lon don SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 1998 (“the HRA”) and article 8 of the European Convention on Human Right s (“the 
ECHR”) be required to consider the proportionality of evicting the occupier;  
(ii) whether, if the answer to question (i) is yes, the relevant legislation, in particular section 
21(4) of the 1988 Act , can be read so as to comply with that conclusion;  
(iii) whether, if the answer to questions (i) and (ii) is yes, the trial judge would have been 
entitled to dismiss the claim for possession in this case, as he said he would have done.  
 
The appellant’s argument is that the judge should have taken into account the proportionality of 
making an order for possession for article 8 purposes and, on that basis, could have refused to make 
an order for possession despite the apparently mandatory terms of section 21(4) of the 1988 Act and 
section 89(1) of the Housing Action 1980 (“the 1980 Act”) , which limits the period for which a court 
can postpone an order for possession taking effect  [29-30]. 
 
It is well established that it is open to the occupier to raise the question of the proportionality of 
making an order for possess ion where the party seeking possession is a public authority within the 
meaning of section 6 of the HRA  [34]. In deciding this issue in the case of Manchester City Council v 
Pinnock [2011] 2 AC 186, the Supreme Court made it clear that nothing in its judgm ent was intended to 
bear on cases where the person seeking possession was a private landowner [37]. The appellant 
contends that the same reasoning applies to a private sector landlord because the court which would 
grant the order for possession is a public  authority for the purposes of the HRA [38-39]. 
 
The court’s preliminary view is that it is not open to the tenant to contend that article 8 could justify a 
different order from that which is mandated by the contractual relationship between the parties, at  
least where there are legislative  provisions through which the democratically elected legislature has 
balanced the competing interests of private sector landlords and residential tenants [40]. Were it 
otherwise, the ECHR could be said to be directly enfor ceable as between private citizens so as to alter 
their contractual rights and obligations [41]. As to the Strasbourg authorities, the admissibility 
decisions of Di Palma v United Kingdom (1988) 10 EHRR CD 149 and Wood v United Kingdom are 
inconsistent wit h the appellant’s case [48]. While subsequent authorities provide some support for the 
notion that article 8 is engaged on the making of the order for possession against a residential occupier 
such as  the appellant, there is no support for the proposition that the judge could be required to 
consider the proportionality of the order which he would have made under legislation such as the 1980 
and 1989 Acts [49-59]. The appeal is accordingly dismissed on the first issue  [59-60]. 
 
As to the second issue, it wou ld not be possible to read section 21(4) of the 1988 Act in the way 
contended for by the appellant [61-70]. Had the court been persuaded that the appellant was right on 
the first issue , a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the HRA would have  been the only 
remedy [70]. 
 
As to the third issue, the judge did not consider whether, if he had found that the claim for possession 
were disproportionate, there might have been other solutions to the problem than dismissing the claim 
[71]. In those rare cases where a court is required to assess the proportionality of making a possession 
order, its powers to suspend or postpone the effect of that order are severely limited by section 89(1) 
of the 1980 Act [72]. The cases in which it would be justifiable to  refuse, as opposed to postpone, a 
possession order must be very few and far between  and could only be cases in which the landlord’s 
interest in regaining possession was heavily outweighed by the gravity of the interference in the 
occupier’s right to respe ct for her home  [73]. On the facts of this case, it seems likely that the most the 
appellant could hope for on a proportionality assessment would be an order for possession in six 
weeks’ time , the maximum permitted by section 89(1) of the 1980 Act  [75].

The Supreme Court  unanimously allows Ms McBride’s  appeal . Lord  Hodge (with whom the other 
Justices agree ) gives the  leading  judgment.  The case is remitted to the original  ET, or to a tribunal 
which includes the member or members of the original ET who are s till in office, to consider in what 
respects it should vary its order for compensation in view of the time that has passed  since the order . 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Hodge observes that t he ET’s order  for reinstatement (set out at [ 18]) viewed alone is not open 
to criticism,  as it reflect s the definition of such orders set out under  s.114(1) of the Employment 
Rights Act 1996. The question is whether the context  in which the  order was made  and the ET’s  
reasoning in support of the order should give  rise to a differ ent interpretation of the order [ 39]. 
 
Lord Hodge answers this question in the negative . The ET was not seeking to impose a contractual 
limitation in the reinstatement order  removing  the excluded duties  (i.e. signing reports and attending 
court  to give evidence)  from Ms McBride’s job description . Rather  it was recognising a practica l 
limitation on the scope of her work caused by circumstances beyond her and her employer’s control  
[40]. This conclusion is supported by four reasons:  
 
(1) The ET was a ware both of Ms McBride’s  terms of employment and that for several years 
previously she had been actively employed as a fingerprint officer but had not been asked or 
allowed to sign reports or give evidence in court . That was the status quo to which  she would 
have returned pursuant to a reinstatement order  [41]. 
 
(2) The ET was aware that Ms McBride  wanted to perform the excluded duties but held that the 
SPSA’s decision that she could not return to those duties was reasonable  [42].  
 
(3) The ET rejected the idea th at continuing in a non -court going role amoun ted to alternative 
employment. It criticised Mr Mulhern’s evidence, which had been calculated to give the 
impression that Ms McBride had done little of value in the previous years,  and accepted the 
evidence of M s McBride’s managers about the  amount of work carried out by  fingerprint 
expert s which does not involve the excluded duties  and their assessment that Ms McBride had 
made a valuable contribution in the years in which her duties had been restricted  [43]. 
 
(4) The ET’s references to Ms McBride being reinstated to a “non-court going fingerprint officer 
role” were in cluded in  parenthesis and spoke of an understanding, which may suggest that the 
ET was considering the practical context of the reinstatement rather tha n an alteration of the 
terms of employment. The words in parenthesis confirmed that the order for reinstatement did 
not amount to an order that the employer must alter the status quo by allowing Ms McBride  to 
resume the excluded duties [ 44]. 
 
Lord Hodge re jects a n additional argument  by the respondent  that the ET’s view on the practicability 
of compliance with the reinstatement order was perverse because it had the potential to expose the 
SPSA to a claim by Ms McBride that it was in fundamental breach of her employment contract  by 
refusing to allow her to perform the excluded duties.  This argument  was not developed in the courts  
below  and, i n any event, would not have succeeded if properly developed at the time in the light of the 
ET’s findings of fact [ 30-31 & 46-52].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
As the  Court of Appeal erred in law, the Supreme Court grant s permission to appeal and must  decide 
for itself whether the interim injunction should be discharged or maintained  [19]. 
 
 The principal error is that the Court of Appeal wrongly directed itself that s 12 HRA enhanced 
the weight to be given to article 10 rights in the balancing exercise , when the  case law  establishes  
that neither article 8 no r article 10 has  prefe rence over the other and what i s necessary i s an 
intense focus on the comparative rig hts being claimed in the individual case [ 20][51].   
 The Court of Appeal  also referred to a ‘limited public interest’ in the story when it had right ly 
held that there was none  in its earlier  judgment [ 21]. There is not, on its own,  any public interest 
in the legal s ense in the disclosure of  private sexual encounters even if they involve infidelity or 
more than one person at the same time , however famous the individual(s) involved  [24][32].  
 It is essential  to distinguish  between the claims for breach of privacy and for breach of 
confidence . The widespread availability  of the information in the public domain may well mean 
that PJS would  face difficulties in obtaining a permanent injunction in  so far as his claim is based 
on confidentiality  [57], but different cons iderations apply to privacy claims, where the impact of 
any additional disclosure on the likely distress to PJS and his family, and the degree of intrusion 
or harassment , continues to be highly relevant. The questi on is whether the injunction can still 
serve a useful purpose.  It is important to consider the medium and form of the previous 
publication: there is a qualitative difference in intrusiveness and distress between the  disclosures 
on the internet which have o ccurred and the media storm which would follow from publication 
by the English media in hard copy , together with unrestricted internet coverage of the story 
[35][63]. 
 Public ation in this form  is contrary to the interests of PJS’s children and in breach of the 
requirement to show an exceptional public interest for the intrusion set out in the Editors’ Code 
of Practice  to which NGN has subscribed  [36]. Lady Hale’s judgment discu sses this conside ration 
further, partly in redacted form to prevent identification [ 72-78] 
 Rights must be practical and effective. The grant of an injunction is the only remedy of any value 
to PJS  and his family , for whom the invasion of privacy occasioned by further discl osure in the 
English media, rather than any award of damages,  is likely to be the real concern [ 43]. 
 The central issue is whether the trial judge is likely to grant a permanent injunction. Balancing all 
these factors, the majority concludes that  PJS is  likely to establish at trial that the proposed 
publication by NGN constitutes  a serious breach of his and his family’s privacy rights, with no 
countervailing  public interest on the present evidence, and that he is likely to  be granted  a 
permanent injuncti on notwithstanding the internet and social  media publication. Accordingly , 
the interim injunction is  maintained  [44-45][68].    
 
Lord Toulson, dissenting, would have upheld the discharge of the injunction. He considers that where 
the information is widely available , the form of the publication should not  make a significant difference: 
the purpose of s 12(3) is to discourage the granting of an injunction to prevent publication of information 
which is already widely known  [89].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal  by the Iraqi civilians , and affirms the Court of 
Appeal’s conclusion that the limitation period was not suspended under article 435(1) of the Iraqi Civil 
Code.  Lord Sumption gives the only  judgment, with which the other Justices agree.   
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Fore ign Limitation Periods Act 1984 requires an English court to apply to English proceedings a 
foreign law of limitation which will have been designed for proceedings in the foreign country . This 
requires  a process of tran sposition. F acts that the foreign law would have treated as relevant to the 
foreign proceedings might be irrelevant to the proceedings in England [ 13].  
 
Where the Iraq i law of limitation depends on some  fact about the proceedings, the English court must 
ask whether that fact is applicable to proceedings brought in England, and not to hypothetical 
proceedings that might have been brought in Iraq [ 15]. CPA Order 17 applies only in Iraq. It is not an The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom

running of the Iraqi law limitation period [ 16].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisse s Eclipse’s appeal . Lord Neuberger  gives the  only judgment, 
with which the other Justices agree.     The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Section 29 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 provide s that the costs of proceedings 
in the FTT shall be in the discretion of the FTT, and that the FTT has pow er to make orders for costs, 
subject to the Tribunal Procedure Rules [2]. The r ules which governed the instant proceedings are the 
Tribunal Procedure (First Tier) (Tax Chamber) Rules 2009 ( SI 2009/273) (L1) (“the Rules”) [3]. 
 
Rule 5 deals with the FTT’s c ase management powers. Rule 5(3) (i) provides that the FTT may, inter 
alia, by direction require a party to produce a bundle for  a hearing.  
 
Rule 10 is headed “Orders for costs”. With one exception, the FTT can only make two types of costs 
order under Rule 10(1): a wasted costs order under 10(1)(a), and an order for costs where a party has 
behaved unreasonably under 10(1)(b). The exception is under 10(1)(c), which provides  that there will 
be no such limitation on the FTT’s jurisdiction to award costs if two conditions are satisfied : (i) that 
the proceedings are a “Complex case” under Rule 23, and (ii) that the taxpayer has not served a 
request , within the requisite 28 -day period , that there should be no potential liability under Rule 
10(1)(c) [6]. 
 
The reason ing of the Court of Appeal and the Upper Tribunal, which is reflected in the Revenue’s 
arguments before the Court, is that the FTT would have had a broad jurisdiction as to costs if no 
request under Rule 10(1)(c)(ii) had been served. However, because such a request was served by  
Eclipse , the FTT could only make a n order for costs if  Rules 10(1)(a) or Rule 10(1)(b) could be 
invoked. Neither of those provisions applied in the present case [14]. 
 
Eclipse raised  two arguments in response. First, it submitted th at the Order was not an order for 
payment of costs, but an order for the sharing of costs. The Court rejects that argument. The Order 
would undoubtedly involve the Revenue paying costs in the sense that they would be reimbursing 
Eclipse half the expenses i t had incurred in preparing the bundle s [15]. 
 
The second argument is that it is inherent in Rule 5(3) that the orders that the FTT makes under that 
provision can include terms as to costs [16]. The Court rejects that argument for a number of reasons 
[16]. First, Eclipse’s  interpretation of Rule 5(3) robs Rule 10(1) of much of its force [17-18]. Secondly , 
Eclipse’s argument is inconsistent with Rules 10(3) to 10(7), which contain rules as to how any costs 
awarded by the FTT pursuant to Rule 10(1) are to be assessed and recovered. If there is a power to 
award costs under Rule 5, there would be a lacuna in the Rules because there are no such provisions 
governing the assessment and recovery of costs in respect of Rule 5 [19]. Thirdly, rejecting Eclipse’s 
case d oes not mean that the FTT cannot give permission to amend, or grant an adjournment, on terms 
as to costs [20]. Fourthly, there is Rule 16(2)(b), which requires the FTT to provide for the costs of a 
witness required to attend a hearing to be paid for one or  other party. This shows that, where the Rules 
intend to enable or require the FTT to render a party liable for costs, they say so [21].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismiss es the appeal  by the Owners, PST Energy .  Lord Mance gives 
the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
There are three  issues before the Supreme Court : (1) Was the contract a contract of sale within the 
meaning of s. 2(1) of SoGA ? (2) If not, was it subject to any implied term that OWB would perform or 
had performed its obligations to its supplier, in particular by paying for the bunkers timeously?  (3) Should 
the Court of Appeal decision F G Wilson (Engineering) Ltd v John Holt & Co (Ltd)  [2014] 1 WLR 2365  
(known as “Caterpillar ”) be overruled?  [22, 24]

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Was the contract a contract of sale under s. 2(1) the Sale of Goods Act 1979 ? 
 
s. 2(1) of SoGA defines a contract of sale of goods a s one “by which the seller transfers or agrees to 
transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a money consideration, called the price.”  OWB argues 
that this was a contract of sale within that definition. But b unker suppliers know that bunkers are for 
use prior to payment  [27]. OWB’s contract with the Owners therefore cannot b e regarded as a 
straightforward agreement to transfer the property in the bunkers to the Owners for a price  under s. 
2(1). It was a  sui generis  (unique) agreement , with two aspects: first, to permit consumption prior to any 
payment and without any property  ever passing in the bunkers consumed; and second, if and so far as 
bunkers remained unconsumed, to transfer the property in the bunkers remaining to the Owners in 
return for the Owners paying the price  for all of the bunkers, whether consumed before or re maining at 
the time of payment [28, 34]. 
 
Even if the contract were to be analysed as a contract of sale , in that it contemplated the transfer of 
property in any bunkers unused at the date of payment,  OWB could not owe any obligation to transfer 
property in bunkers consumed before payment. It would cease to be a contract of sale if and when all 
such bunkers w ere consumed before payment [36-37].  
 
Was there an i mplied term  that OWB would pay timeously ? 
 
In consequence of his conclusion at [28] Lord  Mance finds that OWB’s only implied undertaking as 
regards the bunkers which it permitted to be used , and which were used by the Owners in propulsion 
prior to payment , was that OWB had the legal entitlement to give such permission  [39, 59]. 
 
Should Caterpillar  be overruled?  
 
The Court of Appeal held in Caterpillar  that where goods are delivered under a contract of sale but title 
is reserved pending payment of the price, the seller cannot enforce payment of the price by an action  
[42]. s. 49(1)  of SoGA  enables an action for the price where the seller has transferred property, with or 
without delivery, and the buyer has failed to pay the price due  [44].  Lord Mance considers that s. 49(2) 
reflects an established common law exception to the rule in s. 49( 1) [45]. The question of principle is 
whether s. 49 excludes any claim to recovery of a price outside its express terms. s. 49(2) relaxes only 
partially the strictness of s. 49(1).  
 
The 1893 Act which introduced the wording now found in s.  49(2) reflected the common law in an era 
when freedom of contract and trade were axiomatically accepted as beneficia l. Therefore a  court should 
be cautious about recognising claims to the price of goods in c ases not falling within s. 49 but this leaves 
at least some room for claims for the price in other circumstances [53]. For instance, t he price may be 
recovered in respect of goods undelivered which remain the seller’s property but are at the buyer’s risk 
and are destroyed by perils of the seas or by fire . The present situation is an even stronger example  [57]. 
Lord Mance declined to set the precise limits for the circumstances in which the price may be recoverable 
outside s. 49. Had the contract between OWB and the Owners been one of sale, Lord Mance woul d 
have held, over -ruling the Caterpillar  case on this point, that s. 49 is not a complete code of situations in 
which the price may be recoverable under a contract of sale . In the present case  the price was recoverable 
by virtue of its express terms in the  event which has occurred, namely the complete cons umption of the 
bunkers supplied [58, 60].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal  by the Complaints Commissioner , holding that 
the Commissioner  had (i) no power to recommend  the payment of a money sum  against an individual 
who was not a public authority  in an investigation under article 8 of the Commissione r for Complaints 
(Northern Ireland) Order 1996  and (ii) no power to make a special report drawing the attention of the 
legislature to such a person’s failure to comply with a recommendation . Lord Sumption gives the 
judgment , with which the other Justices a gree. 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Complaints  Commissioner’s power to investigate the complaint were derived from  article 8 of the 
Commissioner for Complaints (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, which deals with complaints against 
individuals , like the GP in this case, providing professional services under contracts or other 
consensual arrangements with the NHS [ 11].   
 
The short answer to this appeal is that the Complaints Commissioner may not , under  article 9 of  the 
1996 Order,  carry out any investigations i n respect of which the complainant has a remedy by way of 
proceedings in a court of law, unless it is not reasonable to expect the complainant to resort to law.  
The widow  had such a  remedy but the Commissioner proceeded with the investigation because she The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 said that she only wished to find out what had gone wrong  (and not to obtain money) . It was not open 
to the Commissioner, having proceeded on that basis, to recommend a payment to her  [17].  
 
More generally , the Complaints  Commissioner does not have the pow er to r ecommend monetary 
redress against individuals in investigations under article 8 . This is because his recommendations are 
not binding as a matter of private law, and a private individual such as a GP has no relevant duties in 
public law. Furthermore,  a private individual has no means of effectively challenging the 
Commissioner’s findings on the merits of the case before a court [ 20, 24 ].  
 
Nor does the Complaints Commissioner have a power to make a special report in default of payment. 
Whilst the Parl iamentary Commissioner and Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland have such a 
power as against departments or public bodies that have been ordered to provide financial redress, the 
Complaints Commissioner does not. This is because the Commissioner’s relat ionship with the 
legislature is different to that of other statutory ombudsmen in the United Kingdom. The 
Commissioner is not an officer of the legislature, unlike the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern 
Ireland, but receives complaints from and reports to the  complainant and individuals or bodies whose 
conduct is at issue. He has no powers of compulsion, and limited powers to use information 
discovered during investigations for the purposes of enforcement [ 20-21, 26-28]. Article 19 of the 1996 
Order is concern ed with the presentation of annual reports before the Assembly, and not reports on 
individual cases such as this [ 29].  
 
Lord  Sumption further comments on the substance of th e Commissioner’s recommendation that the 
GP pay  £10,000  to the widow . A monetary r ecommendation must be rational and capable of 
explanation. The figure in the Commissioner’s report  appears to have been “ plucked out of the air ”: it 
does n ot offer a coherent explanation or calculation, or identify the precise failings in respect of which 
it was made [ 30].

The Supreme Court dismisses Airtours’  appeal by a majority of 3 to 2. Lord Neuberger gives the 
leading judgment, with which Lord Mance and Lord Hodge agree. Lord Carnwath and Lord Clarke 
both give dissenting ju dgments.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In order for the VAT charged by PwC and paid by Airtours to be reclaimable as input tax, it must be 
“VAT on the supply to [Airtours] of any goods or services” [19]. The issue of whether there has been 
a supply of servic es by PwC to Airtours gives rise to two principal questions [20].  
 
The first is whether PwC agreed, under the terms of the Contract, to supply services, and in particular 
to provide the Report [21]. HMRC accept that, if the answer to that question is yes,  the appeal must be 
allowed.  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 PwC’s commitment to provide the services described in the Contract was a contractual commitment to 
the “Engaging Institutions”, and not to Airtours [23], for the following reasons:  
(i) the Letter is addressed “To the Engaging Ins titutions”, and not to Airtours  [24];  
(ii) paragraph 1 of the Letter provides that the Institutions had retained PwC; there is no 
suggestion that Airtours had done so  [24]; 
(iii) paragraph 4 of the Letter provides that any reports are “for the sole use of [those] in stitutions”  
[24]; 
(iv) paragraph 8 of the Letter states that the Report is to be provided to the Institutions and 
Airtours is only to be provided with a copy, which can be redacted [25]; 
(v) paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Letter recognise a duty of care on the part of PwC to the 
Institutions, but does not acknowledge one to Airtours; further , paragraph 11 excludes any 
duty of care or liability to “any other party” [26]. 
 
While Airtours did countersign the Letter, it had to do so in order to be bound by certain provision s, 
such as those relating to the payment of PwC’s fees [28]. The fact that Airtours, rather than the 
Institutions, was to pay PwC for the services, can be fairly said to raise a prima facie expectation that 
PwC would owe a duty to Airtours to provide those  services. However, the Institutions wanted the 
services; there is no indication Airtours would have still paid for those services had that not been the 
case [35]. The same can be said of Airtours’ argument  that it s interest in having a report produced for  
the Institutions  indicates there was a supply of services to it [37]. 
 
The second question arises from Airtours ’ argument that, in any event, in order to succeed on this 
appeal,  it does not have to show  that it had a contractual right to require the servi ces under the 
Contract to be provided to the Institutions by PwC to succeed. Rather, Airtours argues that the fact s 
that (i) it had a substantial commercial interest in the services being provided by PwC and (ii) it not 
merely countersigned the Contract bu t thereby agreed to pay PwC for the services , justify  the 
conclusion that the services were “supplied” to Airtours, as well as the Institutions [43]. 
 
Airtours relies on Lord Millett’s statement in Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Redrow Group Plc 
[1999] 1 WLR 408 that the question to be asked is whether the taxpayer obtained “anything – anything 
at all – used or to be used for the purposes of his business” , but this has to be read in the light of later 
cases  [44-45]. As subsequent authority has clarif ied, that statement should be interpreted consistently 
with the established approach of focusing on economic realities as the fundamental criterion for the 
application of VAT [45].  
 
It is clear from domestic and European Court of Justice judgments that, w here the person who pays 
the supplier is not entitled under the contractual document to receive any services from the supplier, 
then, unless the documentation does not reflect the economic reality, the payer has no right to reclaim 
by way of input tax the VAT in respect of the payment to the supplier [50].  
 
Lord Clarke and Lord Carnwath each give judgments dissenting on the analysis of both the Contract 
and the commercial reality of the relationship between Airtours and PwC. Lord Clarke concludes that, 
in this case, PwC was making two distinct supplies, one to Airtours, and another to the Institutions 
[64-5]. Lord Carnwath considers that it is inappropriate to resolve the appeal on a narrow legalistic 
approach to construction of the Contract, particularly w here the distinction between servi ces to 
Airtours and se rvices to the Institutions is unlikely to have been seen as of any practical significance to 
the parties [81]. He further considers that the argument that Airtours, having paid a £200,000 retainer 
to PwC, did not have an enforceable right , is an impossible one to accept, either as a matter of 
contractual construction or as a matter of economic reality [84].

The Supreme Court allows  Cargill’s  appeal  by a majority of four to one , holding that  the vessel was off  
hire throughout the period of arrest and that the  proviso in clause 49 was not eng aged. Lord Sumption 
gives the  lead judgment , with which Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance and Lord Toulson agree . Lord 
Clarke writes a dissenting judgment, and would have  dismissed the appeal and  held that the vessel was 
on hire.   
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
This appeal raises a question as to the meaning of charterer’s “ agents ” in clause 49 of the charter. If a 
ship is sub -let under a charter, the charter operates as a contract under which rights are enjoyed and 
obligations performed vicariously [ 14]. “Agents ” is not used i n its strict legal sense, but is used to refer 
to persons  or subcontractors  to whom the charterers’ rights are made avail able further down the chain, 
or who satisfy the time charterers’ obligations that have been delegated to them [ 19]. 
 
Not e verything  that a subcontractor does can be regarded as the exercise of a right or the performance 
of an obligation under a time charter. For the purposes of clause 49, there must be a sufficient  nexus 
between the occasion for the arrest and the function wh ich Transclear or IBG were performing as 
“agent” of Cargill [ 21].  
 
The arrest was not “ occasioned by any personal act or omission or default of the Charterers or their agents ”. Firstly, 
Cargill was only responsible for IBG’s acts or omissions in the actua l performance of cargo handling 
operations while they were in progress. Cargill had no obligation to procure discharge at any particular 
time, and no contractual interest in the timing of the operation. In failing to carry out cargo handling 
operations between 15 Oc tober 2008 and 15 January 2009, IBG was  not vicariously exercising Cargill’s 
rights, nor was it  vicariously breaching Cargill’s obligations  under the charter  [28]. Secondly, the arrest 
was occasioned by a dispute between Transclear and IBG about demurrage under the sub -charter. 
That was not the vicarious  exercise  of any right  made available to Cargill under the time charter [ 30].  
 
 The Court of Appeal was wrong to approach the matter by asking in whose “sphere of responsibility” 
the matters occas ioning the arrest lay. The only sense in which the arrest was occasioned by Cargill’ s 
trading arrangements concerning the vessel was that Cargill’s sub -charter to Sigma enabled Transclear 
and IBG to become involved further down the chain, and it was their dispute that caused the arrest. 
That ignores the need for a  sufficient  nexus between the acts leading to the arrest and the performance 
of functions under the charter [ 31].  
 
Lord Clarke, in a dissenting judgment, would have held that the vessel was on hir e during the period of 
the arrest. The agency extended to the operation of the vessel from the giving of the notice of 
readiness (or perhaps earlier), until the completion of dischar ge. An arrest during the period during 
which she was waiting to discharge is the same as an arrest in the cours e of the discharging operations  
[36]. The arrest had nothing to do with NYK , but was linked to Cargill’s discharge functions delegated  
to Transclear and IBG . An absence of cargo handling operations is just as much defec tive 
performance of them. This solution  makes commercial sense, because  the parties knew that demurrage 
might be incurred down the line, because  it was common ground that the vessel  was not off hire by 
reason of IBG’s earlier failure t o provide a working o ff-loader, and because the owners had no control 
over Cargill’s de legation to Transclear and IBG [ 34-58].

which the other Justices agree.  
  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
This appeal requires the Court to consider the SSHD’s policy relating to the detention of  mentally ill  
persons  pending deportation (“the Policy”) and the effect of any  failure by the SSHD to apply that 
Policy , in the light of  the Court of Appeal’s decision in R (Francis)  [4]. 
 
The Policy obliges the  SSHD to conduct monthly reviews of detention pending deportation  [18]. Para 
55.10 provides that those suffering from “serious mental illness which cannot be satisfactorily 
managed within detention” will normally be co nsidered suitable for detention “only in very exceptional 
circum stances”, including for example where there is a  risk of further o ffending or harm to the public 
[19]. In O’s detention reviews  between 4 March  and 4 July 2011, only the briefest reference was  made 
to the Report , and O’s most recent diagnosis was incorrectly identified as being in March 2010 [24]. 
Although the Report was submitted to the SSHD  expressly in support of O’s application to challenge 
her deportation [ 22-23], on any view it bore some relevance to the Policy and should hav e been 
addressed  properly  in the  detention reviews [ 25]. Therefore, a s the Court of Appeal concluded (and the 
SSHD  now accepts), the SSHD  unlawfully failed to apply her  Policy when deciding to continue to 
detain O betw een March and July 2011 [ 26-27]. The refusal to release O  during this period was  
procedurally flawed  [37]. Given that conclusion,  this case does not afford the opportunity  to consider 
the nature of the court’ s review of the legality of  the SSHD’s applicati on of her P olicy [ 28, 37]. 
 
The question is then how the SSHD would have reacted to the Report , had she applied her Policy 
correctly . It is for the C ourt to determine the meaning of the Policy for itself [ 28]. “Satisfactory”  is a 
word  which catches  the various different  factors to which the SSHD may be required  to have regard. 
The discussion of “satisfactory management” in R (Das ) is approved, save that treatment ( available  to a 
detainee only if released)  which would be likely to effect a positive improveme nt in his or her 
condition might be  relevant ; the burden would be on the SSHD  to inquire as to its availability. While 
“satisfactory” does not mean “optimal ” management, a narrow construction of “management” , 
meaning no more than “control” of the illness w ould lack principled foundation [ 30].  
 
The Policy mandates a  practical  inquiry by the SSHD , in the light of the context of immigration 
detention  [31]. The SSHD  should have made  inquiries and obtained answers  to a number of questions  
as to whether, in the light of the Report, O’s illness could satisfactorily be managed at Yarl’s Wood  
[32-33]. The Court cannot predict the result of those inquiries, most of which seem never to have been 
made. The SSHD  would also have had to consider  whether there were very ex ceptional circumstances 
which nonetheless justified O’s detention.  Even on the assumption that the proper application of the 
Policy should in due course have led the SSHD  to direct O’s release, it is unrealistic to consider that 
the conditions necessary fo r her release would have been in place prior to 6 July 2011 , when she was 
released on bail  [34-35]. Were O’s claim for judicial review permitted to proceed , it would result in no 
more than a declaration that her detention was unlawful and an award of  only nominal damages  [38-
40]. The lower court s were entitled  to refuse  O’s application for  permission  [50].   
 
R (Francis)  
  
R (Francis ) was wrongly decided. The power to detain conferred by  para 2(1) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 
Act (pending the making of a depor tation order) and b y the words in  parenthesis in para 2(3)  (pending 
deportation)  is a mandate subjec t to two conditions: first, there must be  a prospect of deportation 
within a reasonable time ; and second , the SSHD must consider  in accordance with the  Policy whether 
to exercise the power to detain. If either condition is not satisfied, the mandate  to detain  ceases and 
detention becomes unlawful  [42-49].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The wording of the  1886 Act by itself does not provide a clear -cut answer  to the issue . In particular,  
s.2(1) does not cl arify whether the “loss” for which a  claimant  may claim compensation  is simply the 
physical damage to his  property, or e xtends to consequential losses  [14-15, 17]. The 1886 Act does not 
expressly provide compensation for either (a) personal injury caused b y rioters, or (b) damage to 
property in the streets (e.g. a parked car) and there i s no jurisprudence to support the view that such 
losses could be claimed. On any view,  therefore,  the Act provides only partial compensation for 
damage caused by rioters [ 16].

Legislative history  
 
The 1886 Act must be construed in the light of the prior legislative history [ 13]. Parliament  first 
provided for compensation for riot damage in the Riot Act  1714  (“the 1714 Act”) . Section 6  provided 
that when rioters had demol ished certain buildings , the inhabitants of the “hundred ” (an historic al 
administrative subdivision of a county or shire) were liable to pay  “damages ” to the injured party [18-
19]. The 1714 Act did not specify the scope of the “damages ” to be paid by the  hundred , so guidance 
was provided by the courts, which extended the right to compensation for loss occasioned to furniture 
and household goods [ 20-23].  
 
However, t his case law  does not support  a general  principle that the hundred  stood as sureties for the 
wrongdoer  [24]. This is because:  
 
(1) While  the 1714 Act imposed on the hundred the obligation to compensate only for loss 
occasioned by the destruction of, or damage to, buildings, the prior laws governing the 
hundred’s liability for a failure to raise hue an d cry imposed no such restriction [ 25]. 
 
(2) While  under the 1714 Act the hundred incurred strict liability for the riot, the prior hue and cry 
legislation allowed the community to escape liability if hue and cry were raised and the 
offenders caught: the hundr ed were not sureties for the offender unless they failed to 
apprehend him [ 26]. 
 
(3) Most importantly, t he legislative history after the 1714 Act shows there was no broad principle 
of compensation . In particular, the wording of the Remedies against the Hundred  (England) 
Act 1827 ( which amended and consolidated the prior legislation and remain ed in force until 
the 1886 Act)  makes it clear that the statutory compensation was confined to physical damage 
to property [ 27-30]. The 1886 Act made certain changes to the  statutory scheme, including  
transferring  the liability to pay compensation from the hundred to the local police authority , 
and directing the police authority to have regard to the claimant ’s conduct  when deciding what 
compensation was due.  None of these c hanges suggest an intention to extend the measure of 
compensation beyond physical damage to property [31-32]. 
 
When regard is h ad to the words of the 1886 Act  in the context of its legislative history, there is no 
reason to think that Parliament ever inten ded that the statutory compensation scheme should mirror 
the rioters’ liability in tort , or should develop as the law of damages for tort developed  [33]. The Act, 
like its predecessors, sets out a self -contained statutory compensation scheme which does not  extend 
to cover consequential losses [ 34].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal  by Asset Land and Mr Banner -Eve, finding that 
Asset Land’s activities amounted to  operating  “collective investment schemes” under section 235 
FSMA, and were thus “regulated activities” for the purpose of section 19.  Lord Carnwath gives the 
lead j udgment.  Lord Sumption  gives a concurring judgment . 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Section 235 FSMA concerns collective investment schemes constituting by arrangements respecting 
property which enable participants to receive profits or income arising from the  acquisition, holding, 
management or disposal of the property. To fall within section 235 the participants in the scheme must 
not have day to day control over the management of the property, and the property must be managed 
as a whole by or on behalf of th e operator of the scheme.  
 
Lord Carnwath addresses the four principle grounds of appeal raised by the Appellants. Ground 1 was 
that the Court of Appeal erred in its identification of the component parts of the arrangements, and 
gave inadequate weight to an  essential feature, namely that each investor intended to, and did own his 
plot(s) outright. Lord Carnwath  reject s the Appellant’s distinction between the arr angements made by 
the operator and how they were perceived by others  as “artificial and unrealisti c”. He finds  that the 
judge was entitled to take the view that the investors’ understanding s conformed to what was intended 
by the operator, and was not required to give special weight to contractual or other documents, 
without regard to their context  [54]. 
 
Ground 2 was that the court erred in treating “the property” under section 235(2) and (3) as each of 
the sites acquired by the company, rather than the aggregate of all the plots sold to individual investors, The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 and should have held that the arrangements l eft investors with the necessary control. Ground 3 argued 
that that the critical question under section 235(3)(b) was whether the arrangements reserved to the 
investor the final decision as to the exploitation of the property pursuant to the arrangements, the 
correct answer to which was yes. Lord Carnwath deals with Grounds 2 and 3 together, finding  that the 
relevant “property” for the purposes of section 235(1) is the whole site, but that management control 
of the property under section 235(2) and (3) may be achieved in different ways, and may not be by 
legal mechanisms or legal control. “Have control” in subsection 2 refers to “the reality” of how the 
arrangements are to be operated [57-59]. Lord Carnwath holds that t he judge was entitled to find that 
the relevant management of the property as a whole comprised the steps necessary to obtain planning  
permission and secure a sale to a developer, and it was no part of the arrangement that the investors 
should have any part in or control over those management a ctivities [60]. 
 
Ground 4 was that the court’s interpretation would potentially interfere with a wide range of legitimate 
business arrangements which should not be characterised as collective investment schemes.  Lord 
Carnwath finds that no issue arises, as  the judge’s application of section 235 on the facts as found by 
him involved no distortion of its natural meaning or intended purpose [63]. 
 
Lord Sumption review s the policy underlying the regulation of collective investment schemes . He finds 
that whether  a scheme is a collective investment scheme depends on what was objectively intended at 
the time the arrangements are made, and not on what later happens [91]. The essence of such a 
scheme is  a lack of legal or practical control by the investor of the profit-generating investment which 
is the subject of the scheme. The  investor exchanges property over which he has entire dominion for 
units in a larger property over which he has more limited rights. A distinction must therefore be made 
between (i) cases wher e the investor retains entire control of the property and simply employs the 
services of an investment professional (who may or may not be the person from whom he acquired it) 
to enhance value; and (ii) cases where he and other investors surrender control over their property to 
the operator of a scheme so that it can be either pooled or managed in common, in return for a share 
of the profits generated by the collective fund.  
 
He holds that the judge was right to say that the mutual understanding based on th e core 
representations made by Asset Land to the investors constituted “arrangements” under section 235, 
and that so far as the contract, disclaimer and publicity material were inconsistent with those 
representations, they were not part of the “arrangement s” [92]. The core representations were 
consistent only with the  “property” the subject of the arrangements being the whole of a site . It was 
the whole site which was to be rezoned and sold to a developer, and the profit which each investor 
would derive wou ld be derived from an aliquot share of the entire sale price for the site [93]. 
 
As to “day -to-day control” , the question must be “in whom would control be vested were control to 
be required”, section 235(2)  must refer to the control exercisable by the inv estors collectively. The 
investors collectively did not have the relevant control of the management of the whole sites because 
common parts were retained by Asset Lan d [94-95]. That left as th e critical question whether the 
property was “managed as a whole ”. That depend ed on whether, objectively, the functions which the 
arrangements assigned to Asset Land after the investor’s acquisition of his plot constituted 
management of the site [97]. The transaction cannot be viewed only in legal terms, and the judge 
found that the dominion of the investors over their plots was in reality an illusion. This was a factual 
assessment by the judge and it is not right for this court to substitute a different view. On this 
narrower ground, Lord Sumption agrees that the schem es are collective investment schemes [102] .

The legal framework for detention pen ding a decision to deport comprises Articles 27 and 28 of the  
Citizens  Directive, as transposed by the EEA Regulations 2006. EEA Nationals  or their family 
mem bers exercising EU rights benefit from powerful protections agai nst their expulsion from the UK, 
and can only be removed if certain limited circumstances apply, including where there are grounds of 
public policy, public security or public health [ 30, 36 ].  
 
The power to detain under regula tion 24(1) does not discriminate without la wful justification against 
EEA n ationals and their family members . The general principle is that Article 18 TFEU is only 
concerned with the way in which EU citizens are treated in  member states other than their states of 
nationality, and not the way in which member states treat nationals of other countries residing within 
their territories – see the decision of the European Court of Justice in Vatsouras and Koupstantze v 
Arbeitsgem ainscha ft (AGRE) Nurnnerg  (Joined Cases C -22/08, C -23/08) [2009] ECR I 4585. Third 
country nationals are not appropriate comparators for testing discrimination: s uch “discrimination ” is 
simply a function of the limited scope of the EU  legal order, into whi ch third country nationals do not 
fall [39-49]. Nor is there discrimination between EU nationals and third country nationals contrary to 
article 21(1) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights [ 50-51, 61, 104].  
 
The appellant’s new way of putting this argum ent was that discrimination occurs b etween British 
nationals and EEA  nationals (exercising treaty rights)  who each have third country spouses , since the 
spouse of the EEA  national who is liable to be detained might be hypothetically deterred from 
exercisin g their own free movement rights – the principle in  Surinder Singh  (R v Immigration Appeal 
Tribunal Ex p Secretary of State for the Home Department (Case C370/90) [1992] 3 All ER 798).  But this 
argument also fails, since  there is no basis for holding that the actual or hypothetical rights  of this  
appellant’s spouse, who was long since estranged, would be so affected in this case [ 52-60, 104]  
 
As to proportionality, i t is not in dispute that r egulation 24(1) must be a pplied proportionately, but  it 
was not a rgued that it was applied disproportionately in this case [ 62]. In this case,  the absence of a 
specified time limit for detention does not infringe the principle s in R v Governor of Durham Prison, Ex P 
Hardial Singh  [1984] 1 WLR 704. That approach is fact -sensitive, and the clear statutory framework 
here provides sufficient judicial scrutiny. The Hardial Singh  approach, moreover, is entirely consistent 
with European law [ 63-78, 105].  
 
Finally, regulations 21 and 24 do not fail accurately to transpose the s afeguards in articles 27 and 28 of 
the Directive  and are compliant with it  [80-84, 106].  
  
The recent  CJEU  decision in JN v Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie  (Case C -601/15), brought to the 
Court’s attention in written submissions after the conc lusion of the hearing, concerns a different 
Directive that is not binding on the United Kingdom. It also  materially differs from the Citizens 
Directive because it contains an express freestanding power of detention for applicants for 
international protecti on, and not detention pending a deportation decision. It does not affect the 
disposal of this appeal [ 88-96].   
 
Lord Carnwath writes a concurring judgment, setting out the appellant’s four overall challenges and 
agreeing with Lord Clarke that they should be dismissed [ 97-107].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The context in which the question of jurisdiction arises is important. Free movement of workers and 
their families within the EU has led to many children residing in states of which they are not nationals. 
Inevitably some of them require protection from ill -treatment or neglect, or the risk of it. In every case 
it is necessary for the court to consider whether the case should be transferred to another state [ 2]. It is 
particularly important where the English court might exercise its power to place children for adoption 
without parental consent, on the basis that the welfare of the child requires this, as this power is 
unavailable in many other member states [ 3]. 
 
Althou gh the question of the applicability of article 15 to public law care proceedin gs is currently  the 
subject of a pending reference  to the Court of Justice of the European Union  in a case from  Ireland, 
the Supreme Court proceed s on the assumption that articl e 15 i s capable of applying  and review s the 
decisions of the courts below on their merits , rather than making a further reference. The best interests 
of the girls require s a decision on their future without yet further delay [ 35, 54 ]. As for the correct 
approach to article 15, the language is simple and clear  and the court can  apply it to the facts of this 
case without awaiting the outcome of the reference [ 57]. 
 
The princi pal issue is the nature of the ‘best interests’ assessment in article 15 and whether it is limited 
to questions relevant to the choice of forum, as the judge had found. The addit ion of the best interests 
test is  intended to be an additional safeguard for the child , consistent with the rights of children found 
in article 24 of the Charter o f Fundamental Rights of the European Union [ 41-42]. While a number of 
factors will be relevant both to the question of whether a court is ‘better placed’ to hear the 
proceedings and of whether transfer is in the ‘best interests’ of the child, these are sep arate questions 
and must be addressed separately. Th e answer to the second does not inexorably  follow from the first 
[43]. The question is whether the transfer  (rather than the eventual outcome) is in the child’s best 
interests but the impact of the transf er on the welfare of the child and on the choices available to the 
court deciding the eventual outcom e must be considered  [44]. 
 
In the present case, the short term effect of the transfer would be to remove the girls from the home 
where Ella had lived for virtually her whole life and Janetta for most of hers, where they were happy 
and settled, to an unfamiliar foster placement in Hungary; and the long term effect would be to rule 
out one possible option for their future care and upbringing , which was to rem ain in their present 
home either through adoption, or a special guardianship order or ordinary residence order. This is not 
necessarily the outcome which the court should eventually decide, as questions of maintaining links  
with the girls’ extended family in Hungary and ethnic background will also be important factors [ 45-
46]. But the judge failed to consider whether the English court could achieve the same outcomes in 
Hungary as the Hungarian courts, without the need to transfer the case, whi ch would also preserve  the 
options to keep the girls in their present home [ 48-49]. The English court was also better placed to 
decide the outcome as it had already heard all the evidence that those involved wished to put before it 
[50]. These were crucial factors which  had been left out of account [ 51]. 
 
The judge had been wrong to apply article 15 to the placement order proceedings but this did not in 
itself vitiate his decision to transfer the care proceedings. He had the power to stay the  placement 
order proceedings  under the wide case management powers of the court and, if it had been right to 
uphold the transfer, then it would clearly have been right to stay the placement order proceedings [ 53]. 
 
The case is therefore returned to the High Court to determine the futu re arrangements for the girls, 
with updated  evidence. The full range of ou tcomes will be open to the court , not simply the stark 
choice between closed adoption and a foster placement in Hungary, and the judge  will apply the 
extended guidance given by the C ourt of Appeal in this case [ 61].

The Supreme Court unanimously  (i) dismisses the appeal regarding  the seaward boundary , finding that the 
boundary is  determined by the lowest astronomical tid e, and (ii)  allows the appeal in relation to the second 
issue, holding that the Estate’s right to fish does not extend to the sandbanks which attach to the 
Foreshore as and when they become so attached. Lord Neuberger and Lord Carnwath give a joint 
judgmen t, with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
There are two important principles which apply to both issues. The first principle is that unless it is taken 
away from them, the public have the right to gather fish and shellfish from th e foreshore and since Magna 
Carta it has not been possible for the Crown, the owner of the foreshore, to grant a private fishery (which  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1 887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 ousts the public right) [32-35]. The second principle is that, in order to establish that he has obtained a 
fishery (as with any right) by prescription, a person must establish that he has physically enjoyed the fishery 
“as of right” for the requisite period, so the extent of the right must be determined by the extent of the 
actual or probable use in the past, not by inquir ing into the mind of the notional grantor [44-47].  
 
The first issue : the seaward boundary  
 
Resolving the first issue involves answering two question s. The first is whether the western boundary is 
fixed or whether it  fluctuates with the relevant low mark , because,  over time, the low water marks , marking  
the edge of the sea at low water had moved further seaward  [57]. The Court concludes that it is a 
fluctuating boundary. The evidence clearly establishes that during the substantial period during which the 
prescriptive Right to take shellfish from the Foreshore was exercised, the only way in which the shellfish 
were gathered was by individuals walking from the land when the tide was out [58]. In those 
circumstances, it was very likely that the putative Right w ould have been exercised over an area which was 
defined or limited by a shifting low tide mark [58]. It is not as if the existence of such a fluctuating right 
would have detrimentally affected any other interests  of any significant value [60]. 
 
The second question is which of the suggested low water marks is the appropriate boundary [57]. The 
Court concludes that the most satisfactory low water mark is the lowest astronomical tide , as this  means 
that all parts of the Foreshore which are at any time uncovere d by the sea are included in the Area, whereas 
any other selection involves some of those parts being excluded from the Area [64].  
 
The second issue: the previously separated sandbanks  
 
As to the respondents’ first argument, the evidence does not establis h that the Estate’s  prescriptive  Right 
extends to sandbanks which were not previously joined to the Foreshore as and when they become so 
attached [70].  
 
There are two distinctions between the change in the Foreshore and the fluctuation of the low tide mar k 
boundary. First, (while the silting up of channels which leads to the attachment is gradual ), the actual 
attachment of sandbanks to the Foreshore itself will happen at one moment , whereas  the shifting of the 
low tide mark  will normally be gradual [71].  
 
Second, and of particular significance, the public will have had the right to take fish, including shellfish, 
from such a sandbank. Unlike the position in relation to the fluctuating low tide mark, and notwithstanding 
the respondents’ contention to the co ntrary, it is by no means plain or obvious that, once a sandbank 
became attached to the Foreshore, the Estate would have exercised an exclusive Right to take shellfish 
from that former sandbank  [72-73]. In fact, it appears unlikely that local fisherman wou ld have been 
prepared to accept the Estate maintaining its exclusive Right to fish over former sandb anks which became 
attached to the  Foreshore [73]. The fact that it is common ground between the parties that one of the 
sandbanks, Stubborn Sand, falls with in the Area, is not inconsistent with the Court’s conclusion [74].  
 
As to the Respondents’ second argument, based on accretion, the doctrine of  accretion is concerned with 
gradual and imperceptible changes in a boundary; in the present case, however, ther e is a specific moment 
in time when the whole of a sandbank becomes attached to the Foreshore [78]. There is a difference in 
kind between the gradual extension of one recognised bank and the joining up of two formerly distinct 
banks . There is no room for t he doctrine of accretion in relation to the sandbanks which became 
connected to the foreshore in the present case  [80]. 
 
Conclusion  
 
The Court would only be able to define the precise extent of the Area if the parties were able to agree it 
following receip t of the Court’s judgment. In the absence of agreement, the Court considers that the best 
course of action would be to remit the proceedings to the Chancery Division to enable the precise extent 
of the Area to be identified [83].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  HMRC’s appeal s. Lord Reed gives the lead judgment, with 
which the other Justices agree . 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Reed explains that the case of W T Ramsay Ltd v Inland Revenue Comrs [1982] AC 300 extended the 
purposive approach to statutory construction, which wa s orthodox in other areas of the law, to tax 
cases. It also established that the analysis of the facts depend s on that purposive construction of the 
statute [61-62]. Taxing statutes  generally draw their life -blood from real world transactions with real 
world economic effects. Where an enactment is of that character, and a tran saction, or an element of a 
composite transaction, has no purpose other than tax avoidance , it can usually be said that to allow tax The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 treatment to be governed by transactions which have no real world purpose of any kind is inconsistent 
with that fundamental  characteristic. Where schemes in volve intermediate transactions inserted for the 
sole purpose of tax avoidance, it is quite likely that a purposive interpretation will result in such steps 
being disregarded for fiscal purposes  [64]. 
 
In the present appeal s, Lord Reed begins by asking whether a purposive interpretation of the 
legislation is possible. The context of Chapter 2 , and the background to its enactment, provide  some 
indicatio n of Parliament’s intention. The purposes of Part 7 were broadly identifie d in Grays Timber 
Products  Ltd v Revenue and Customs Comr s [2010] UKSC 4 as being: (i) to promote employee share 
ownership by encouraging share incentive schemes; (ii) since such schemes require benefits to be 
contingent on future performance, creating a p roblem if tax is charged on the acquisition of the shares, 
to wait and see in such cases until the contingency has fallen away; an d (iii) to counteract consequent 
opportunities for tax avoidance [74]. The background to the enactment of Chapter 2 indicates that it 
was intended to address  practical problems, and to forestall  opportunities for tax avoidance [75].  
 
It is difficult to accept that Parliament intended to encourage , by exemption from taxation , the award 
of shares to employees, when the award of such shares has no purpose other than the obtaining of the 
exemption itself [77]. The section 425(2)  exemption , in respect of the acquisition of securities which 
are “restricted securit ies” by virtue of section 423(2) , was designed to address practical probl ems 
arising from valuing a benefit which was, for business or commercial  reasons, subject to a restrictive 
condition involving a contingency . Nothing suggests that Parliament intended that section 423(2) 
should also apply to restrictive conditions that hav e no business or commercial purpose , but are 
deliberately contrived solely to take advantage of the exemption [78]. This is not undermined by the 
section 429  exemption , which is confined to two specific situations falling within the broader section 
425 exe mption, whose purposes are consistent with the general approach to Chapter 2 [80]. The fact 
that Parliament has expressly dealt with tax avoidance in Chapters 3A to 3D does not support the 
inference that Parliament’s intentions in relation to anti -avoidanc e had been exhaustively expressed 
[82]. Lord Reed concludes that the reference in section 423(1) to “any contract, arrangement or 
condition which makes provision to which any of subsections (2) to (4) applies” is to be construed as 
being limited to provisi on having a business or commercial purpose, and as not applying to 
commercially irrelevant conditions whose only purpose is the obtaining of the exemption [85]. 
 
In the UBS case, Lord Reed finds that the condition was completely arbitrary, and had no busin ess or 
commercial rationale. Further, the economic effect of the restrictive condition was nullified by the 
hedging arrangements, except to an insignificant and pre -determined extent. Accordingly, the 
condition should be di sregarded, with the consequence  that the shares are not “restricted securities” 
within the meaning of section 423 [86-7]. The condition in the DB case  operated only for a very short 
period, during which the possibility that it might be triggered lay largely within the control of the 
emplo yee who would be adversely affected. It had no business or commercial purpose, and thus f ell 
outside  section 423 [88].  
 
Having found that the exemption does not apply, Lord Reed holds that the proper basis for taxation 
of the bonuses is as shares , and not  as cash.  The shares did not simply functi on as a cash delivery 
mechanism:  the amount of cash for which the shares might be redeemed was neither fixed nor 
ascertainable when the shares were acquired [92]. The value of the shares has to be assessed as at the 
date of their acquisition , and the restrictive conditions must be taken into account, as ordinary taxation 
principles re quire the tax to be based on the shares’  true value  [94-5].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisse s Magmatic’s  appeal . Lord Neuberger gives the only 
judgment, with which the other Justices agree.     
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Community Design Right is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 (“the Principal 
Regulation”), which provides that a design shall be protected to the extent that it is new and has 
individual character [7]. What matters is the overall impression create d by it, and that potential 
customers  will appreciate it on the basis of its distinctiveness  [6, 10] . 
 
In considering an issue of this nature, an appellate court should not reverse a judge’s decision unless he 
has erred in principle [24]. The Court of Appe al decide d that issue for itself and came to a different 
conclusion from the judge on the basis of three  criticisms of the judge’s approach [16-22]. Therefore 
the essential question in this appeal is whether those criticisms were justified [26]. 
 
The first  criticism was that the judge failed to give proper weight to the overall impression of the CRD 
as an animal with horns, which was significantly different from the impression made by the Kiddee 
Case, which were either an insect with antennae or an animal w ith ears [21]. The overall impression 
given by the CRD is  indeed  that of a horned animal; and the judge  did not specifically refer to this The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.s upremecourt.uk  
 when comparing the CRD with the Kiddee Case [37]. A trial judge cannot be expected in every case to 
refer to all the points which influenced his decision, but when a judge has given a full and careful 
judgment, conscientiously identifying a significant number of points which weigh with him, an 
appellate court can properly conclude that his failure to mention a n important  point means that he has 
overlooked  it. This was the case here [39].  
 
The second criticism wa s that the judge failed to take into account the effect of the lack of 
ornamentation to the surface of the CRD [21], i.e. that the absence of decoration reinforce d the 
horned animal impression [40]. This has limited  force; unless it  simply consisted of items such as  eyes 
and a mouth, any decoration could well detract from the animal impression and even  such items  could 
be said to distract attention from the horns [41]. The Court of Appeal’s second criticism was correct, 
although it is  only a relatively minor point which mildly reinforce s the first criticism [49]. 
 
The third criticism was that the judge ignored the colour contrast in the CRD between the body of the 
suitcase and its wheels [21]. He described the CRD as constitut ing a claim “evidently for the shape of 
the suitcase” and decorations on the Kiddee Case were therefore to be ignored [51]. The CRD 
consisted of CADs of an item whose main body appears as a unif orm grey but which had black strip s, 
a black strap and black wheels. The natural inference to be drawn is that the components shown in 
black are intended to be in a contrasting colour to that of the main body. Accordingly, the Court of 
Appeal was correct : the CRD claimed not merely a shape, but a shape in two contrasting colours  [53] 
and the judge  was wrong in holding that the CRD was simply a claim for shape [53].  
 
Accordingly , the Court of Appeal were right  to hold that the judge  materially misdirected himself and 
could properly  consider the question of infringement for themselves. As the y approached the question 
of infringement on the correct basis in law, this Court should be very slow indeed to interfere with 
their conclusion that the Kiddee Case did not infringe the CRD [56]. The Court has  sympathy for 
Magmatic and Mr La w, as the idea of the Trunki case was a clever one, but Design Right is intended to 
protect designs not ideas [57].   
 
Magmatic contended that  the second criticism raised the  question  whether the absence of 
ornamentation can as a matter of law be considered a feature of design and if so whether it was a 
feature of the CRD in this case [42]. Magmatic further argued, with the support of the Comptroller 
General of Patents Designs and Trad emarks, that this question should be referred to the Court of 
Justice of the European Union as it is neither acte clair nor acte éclairé  [42].    
 
This Court rejects b oth arguments. The Court of Appeal was not raising a freestanding point that 
absence of d ecoration was  a feature of the CRD  [43]. In any event, it is not arguable that  that an 
absence of ornamentation cannot be a feature of a CRD [44-48, 60] . As to the question of whether 
absence of ornamentation was a feature of the CRD in the presence case, the Court of Appeal did not 
resolve this issue and it is unnecessary to do so in the present appeal [50]. Accordingly, no  reference to 
the CJEU need s to be made, and the appeal is dism issed [59-61].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Claimant’s appeal and holds the Respondent  
vicariously liable for the actions of its employee , Mr Khan , in attacking the Claim ant. Lord Toulson 
gives the lead judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The close connection test has been followed at the highest level [42] and there is nothing wrong 
with it as such [46]. In the present case, t he court has to consider two matters. First, the court 
must ask what function or field of activities has been entrusted  by the employer to the employee 
(i.e. what was the nature of his job) . This is to be viewed broadly [44]. Second, the court must 
decide whether there was a sufficient connection between the position in which he was employed 
and his wrongful condu ct to make it right for the employer to be held liable  [45].   
 
Applying that test here,  it was Mr Khan’s job to attend to customers  and respond  to their inquiries. 
His conduct  in responding to the Claim ant’s request with abuse was inexcusable , but interacting 
with customers was within the field of activities assigned to him by his employer . What happened 
there after was an unbroken sequence of events . The connection  between  the field of activities 
assigned to Mr Khan and his employment  did not cease  at the moment  when  he came out from  
behind the counter  and followed the Claim ant onto the forecourt . There are two reasons to draw 
this conclusion. First , it is not correct to regard Mr Khan as having metaphorically  taken  off his 
uniform the  moment  he stepped out from  behind  the counter  - he was following up on what he 
said to the Claim ant. Secondly,  when Mr Khan followed the Claim ant to his car  and told him not 
to come back to the petrol station , that was not something personal between them , but an order 
to keep away from  his employer’s premises . In giving the order  he was purporting to act about his 
employer’s business  [47].  
 
Mr Khan’s motive  in the attack  is irrelevant . It does not matter whether he was motivated by 
personal racism rather th an a desire to benefit his employer’s business  [48].  
 
Lord Dyson agree s with the reasons given by Lord Toulson [57] and emphasises that the close 
connection test is the correct test to apply [53].

The Supreme Court  unanimously  dismisses  the Ministry of Justice’s appeal . Lord Reed gives the lead 
judgment, with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Reed gives guida nce on the sort of relations hip which may  give rise to vicarious liability . In 
Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 56, (“the Christian Brothers  case”) , Lord 
Phillips mentioned five factors which make it fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability on a 
defendant, where the defendant and the tortfeasor are not bound by a contract of employment [19]. 
Lord Reed explains that these five facto rs are not equally significant. The first  factor , that the 
defendant is more likely  to have the means to compensate the victim and can be expected to have 
insured against vicarious liability , is unlikely to be of independent significance in most cases [20]. The 
fifth factor, that the tortfeasor will have been under the control of the def endant, no longer has the 
significance it was sometimes considered to have . In modern life, it is not realistic to look for a right to 
direct how an employee should perform his duties as a necessary element in the employment 
relationship [21]. The remainin g three factors are inter -related. These are (1) the tort will have been 
committed as a result of activity being taken by the tortfeasor on behalf of the defendant; (2) the 
tortfeasor’s activity is likely to be part of the business activity of the defendan t; and (3) the defendant, The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 by employing the tortfeasor to carry on the activity, will have created the risk of the tort committed by 
the tortfeasor [22]. A relationship other than one of employment is in principle capable of giving rise 
to vicarious liabili ty where harm is wrongfully done by an individual who carries on activities as an 
integral p art of the defendant’s business and  for its benefit  (rather than his activities being entirely 
attributable to the conduct of a recognisably independent business of  his own or of a third party), and 
where the commission of the wrongful act is a risk created by the defendant by assigning those 
activities to that individual [24].   
 
The general approach described in Christian Brothers is not confined to a special categ ory of cases, but 
provides a basis for identifying the circumstances in which vicarious liability may in principle be 
imposed outside employment relationships . It extends the scope of vicarious liability beyond the 
responsibility of an employer for the act s and omissions of its employees in the course of their 
employment, but not to the extent of imposing such liability where a tortfeasor’s activities are entirely 
attributable to the conduct of a recognisably independent business of his own, or of a third p arty. This 
enables the law to maintain previous levels of protection for th e victims of torts, despite changes in the 
legal relationships between enterprises and members of their workforces which may be motivated by 
factors extraneous to the enterprises’ a ctivities or attendant risks  [29]. The defendant need not be 
carrying on activities of a commercial nature. The benefit which it derives from the tortfeasor’s 
activities need not take the form of a profit. It is sufficient that ther e is a defendant carryin g on  
activities in the furtherance of its own interests. The individual for whose conduct it may be vicariously 
liable must carry on activities assigned to him by the defendant as an integral part of its operation and 
for its benefit . The defendant must, b y assigning those activ ities to the tortfeasor, have created a risk of 
his committing the tort  [30]. A wide range of circumstances can satisfy those requirements , and 
defendants cannot avoid vicarious liability on the basis of arguments about the employmen t status of 
the tortfeasor  [31].  
 
Prisoners working  in kitchens are integrated into the operation of the prison. The activities assigned to 
them form an integral part of the activities the prison carries on in the furtherance of its aims, in 
particular th e provision of meals to prisoners. The fact that these aims serve the public interest is not a 
bar to the imposition of vicarious liability. The prison service places these prisoners in a position where 
there is a risk that they may commit a variety of neg ligent acts  in carrying out assigned activities , which 
is recognised by the provision of health and safety training . The prisoners work under the direction of 
prison staff. Mrs Cox was injured as a result of Mr Inder’s negligence in carrying on activities  assigned 
to him, and the prison service is therefore vicariously liable to her [32].  
 
The MOJ’s arguments that requiring prisoners to work serves the purpose of rehabilitation and that 
the prisoners have no interest in furthering the objectives of the pri son service are rejected. 
Rehabilitation is not the sole objective. Penal policy also aims to ensure that convicted prisoners 
contribute to the cost of their upkeep. When prisoners work in the prison kitchen they are integrated 
into the operation of the pr ison, and their activities are of direct and immediate benefit to the prison 
service itself [34]. The fact that a prisoner is required to undertake work for nominal wages binds him 
into a closer relationship with the prison service than would be the case f or an employee, and 
strengthens the case for imposing vicarious liability [35]. Payment of a wage is not essential for the 
imposition of vicarious liability [37]. Nor is it necessary for the prison to have an unrestricted pool 
from which to select a workfo rce. The prisoners who work in the kitchen are selected with particular 
care, havin g regard to the risks involved  [38]. In cases where the criteria set out in Christian Brothers are 
satisfied, it should not generally be necessary to re -assess the fairness,  justice and reasonableness of the 
result. The criteria are designed to ensure that vicarious liability is imposed where it is fair, just and 
reasonable to do so [41].

Calculating damages for loss of dependency from the date of death, rather than the date of trial, means 
that the claimant suffers a discount for early receipt of the money when in fact that money will not be 
received until after trial, a discount that results in under -compensation in most cases [7]. 
 
A ruling  that damages should  be assessed from the date of trial would involve departing from the 
established law as laid down by the House of Lords in Cookson v Knowles [1979] AC 556 and Graham v 
Dodds [1983] 1 WLR 808 . Therefore, the question is whether this is a case in which the C ourt should 
apply the 1966 Practice Statement and depart from precedent [19-22].  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The Court has no hesitation in concluding that it should do so in the present case [23]. In the current 
legal climate, the application of the reasoning in the two House of L ords decisions is illogical and its 
application also results in unfair outcomes.  
 
The most important reason for coming to that view is that there has been a material change in the 
relevant legal landscape [23]. Cookson v Knowles [1979] AC 556 and Graham v  Dodds [1983] 1 WLR 808 
were decided in a different era, when the calculation of damages for personal injury and death was 
nothing like as sophisticated as it is now and the use of actuarial evidence or tables was discouraged 
[12]. Lord Bridge, in Dodds , outlined two concerns which were said to justify the rule. First, adopting 
the date of death reduced the need to deal with uncertainties around what would have happened to the 
deceased between the death and the date of trial. Secondly, were the date of tria l to be adopted, this 
would lead to the anomaly that, the longer the trial were delayed , the more a claimant would be able to 
recover [13-15].  
 
The Ogden Tables were produced in 1984 and endorsed by the House of Lords in the landmark case 
of Wells v Wells  [1999] 1 AC 354. As the Ogden Tables include fatal accident calculations based on the 
recommendations of the Law Commission, there is now a perfectly sensible way of addressing the first 
of Lord Bridge’s concerns [16-17]. As to the second of Lord Bridge’s  concerns, this is less of an issue 
due to the respect in which the litigation landscape has been transformed since 1 984; under the Civil 
Procedure R ules 1998, the court is now in a position to set timetables and insist that the parties keep to 
them. In an y event, the proper use of the Ogden Tables makes the concern irrelevant [18]. 
 
Another reason why the Court should depart from Cookson and Dodds is that the unfair effect of the 
rule as set out in those cases , has led courts to distinguish them on inadequ ate grounds, which means 
that certainty and consistency are being undermined [8-9, 23] .

The unanimous conclusion of the court is that Chan Wing -Siu and Powell and English  did take a wrong 
turning and these appeals should  therefore be allowed . The correct rule is that foresight is simply 
evidence (albeit sometimes strong evidence) of intent to assist or encourage , which is the proper 
mental element for establishing secondary liability . 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The co urt has been concerned with a part of the law of secondary liability for crime.  It concerns the 
person who did not himself forge the document, fire the gun or stab the victim (the person who did is 
called ‘the principal’), but who is said to have encouraged or assisted the principal to do so.   
 
There is no question that persons who are indeed together responsible for a crime are all guilty of it, 
whether as principals or secondary parties. Sometimes it is not possible to determine exactly whose 
hand performed the vital act, but this does not matter providing that it is proved the each defendant 
either did it himself of  intentionally assisted or encouraged it. These cases do not affect that basic rule 
at all.   
 
Within this part of the criminal law, the court has been concerned with a narrower sub -part.  This 
concerns secondary parties who have been engaged with one or m ore others in a criminal venture to 
commit crime A, but in doing so the principal commits a second crime, crime B. In many of the 
reported cases crime B is murder committed in the course of some other criminal venture, but the rule 
of law is not confined t o cases of homicide, or indeed to cases of violence. The question is:  what is the 
mental element which the law requires of the secondary party ? 
 
This narrower area of secondary responsibility has sometimes been labelled “joint enterprise”, but this 
is to misuse that expression. To speak of a joint enterprise is simply to say that two or more people 
were engaged in a crime together.  That, however, does not identify  what mental element must be 
shown in the secondary party.  The particular narrower area of s econdary responsibility here in 
question – where crime B is committed during the course of crime A - has been, in the past, more 
precisely been labelled “parasitic accessory liability”.   
 
The two cases of Chan Wing -Siu and Reg v Powell and English held th at in the kind of situation described, 
the mental element required of the secondary party (D2) is simply that he foresaw the possibility that 
D1 might commit crime B.  If D2 did foresee this, the cases treated his continued participation in 
crime A not sim ply as evidence that he intended to assist crime B, but as automatic authorisation of it.  
So D2 was guilty under this rule, even if he did not intend to assist crime B at all.  This set a lower test 
for D2 than for D1, who will be guilty of crime B only i f he has the necessary mental element for that 
crime, usually intent.  And it is in contrast to the usual rule for secondary parties, which is that the 
mental element is an intention to assist or encourage the principal to commit the crime.  
 
The conclusion  of this court is that once the two questioned decisions are fully analysed, it is plain that 
they did take a wrong turning in their reasoning, even if the outcome might well have been the same if 
the error had not been made.  The prior cases which were re lied on were only part of the history and 
important cases were not discussed.  The decisions departed from the well -established rule that the 
mental element required of a secondary party is an intention to assist or encourage the principal to 
commit the cr ime.  They also advanced arguments based on the need that co -adventurers in crimes 
which result in fatality should not escape conviction, without considering whether the secondary 
parties would generally be guilty of manslaughter in any event.   
 
The law i n this field has always been a matter of the common law rather than of statute, and so it is 
right for the courts, which have created it, to investigate whether a wrong turning was taken.   The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
The court holds, in a unanimous judgment, that the law must be se t back on the correct footing which 
stood  before Chan Wing -Siu.  The mental element for secondary liability is intention to assist or 
encourage the crime.  Sometimes the encouragement or assistance is given to a specific crime, and 
sometimes to a range of crimes, one of which is committed ; either  will suffice. Sometimes the 
encouragement or assistance involves an agreement between the parties, but in other cases it takes the 
form of more or less spontaneous joining in a criminal enterprise; again, either wi ll suffice.  Intention 
to assist is not the same as desiring the crime to be committed.  On the contrary, the intention to assist 
may sometimes be conditional, in the sense that the secondary party hopes that the further crime will 
not be necessary, but if  he nevertheless gives his intentional assistance on the basis that it may be 
committed if the necessity for it arises, he will be guilty.  In many cases, the intention to assist will be 
co-terminous with the intention (perhaps conditional) that crime B be  committed, but there may be 
some where it exists without that latter intention.  It will remain relevant to enquire in most cases 
whether the principal and secondary party shared a common criminal purpose, for often this will 
demonstrate the secondary par ty’s intention to assist.  The error was to treat foresight of crime B as 
automatic authorisation of it, whereas the correct rule is that foresight is simply evidence (albeit 
sometimes strong evidence) of intent to assist  or encourage . It is a question for  the jury in every case 
whether the intention to assist or encourage is shown.   
 
This brings the mental element of the secondary party back into broad parity with what is required of 
the principal.  The correction is also consistent with the provision mad e by Parliament in a closely 
related field, when it created  (by the Serious Crime Act 2007 ) new offences of intentionally 
encouraging or assisting the commission of a crime, and provided that a person is not to be taken to 
have had that intention merely be cause of foreseeability.   
 
The court makes clear what the  present cases do not decide. First, they do not affect the law that a 
person who joins in a crime which any reasonable person would realise involves a risk of harm, and 
death results, is guilty at least of manslaughter. Manslaughter cases can vary in their gravity, but may be 
very serious and the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. Secondly, they do not affect the rule that 
a person who intentionally encourages or assists the commission of a crim e is as guilty as the person 
who physically commits it. Thirdly, they do not alter the fact that it is open to a jury to infer intentional 
encouragement or assistance, for example, from weight of numbers in a combined attack, whether 
more or less spontaneo us or planned, or from knowledge that weapons are being carried. It is a 
commonplace for juries to have to decide what inferences they can properly draw about intention 
from an accused person’s behaviour and what he knew.   
 
This necessary correction to th e wrong turning taken by the law does not mean that every person 
convicted in the past as a secondary party, where the law as stated in Chan Wing -Siu was applied, will 
have suffered an unsafe conviction.  A correction to the law does not have this effect.  The outcome 
may in many cases have been the same.  Those whose convictions are outside the time limit for 
appealing would require the exceptional leave of the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, to challenge 
them out of time.  It is for that court to enqu ire whether substantial injustice would occur in any 
particular case, but it is not the law that that is shown simply because the rules which then prevailed  
have now been declared to have contained a flaw. The same rules apply where the Criminal Cases 
Review Commission is asked to consider referring a case to the Court of Appeal.  
 
In these two cases, the convictions for murder must be set aside because the law was wrongly 
understood and the appeals were brought in time. In Jogee it was argued on his behalf  that he ought 
not to have been convicted of either murder or manslaughter and that his conviction should simply be 
quashed.  That argument was quite unrealistic.  On the evidence and the jury’s verdict he was 
unquestionably guilty at least of manslaughter , and there was evidence on which the jury could have 
found him guilty of murder on a proper direction. The court will ask for written submissions from 
both parties whether there should be a re -trial for murder or whether the conviction for murder 
should b e replaced by a conviction for manslaughter. In the case of Ruddock there were other, 
unrelated, misdirections.  The Board asks for written submissions from both sides, now that the 
correct position in law has been identified, as to what should be the appr opriate disposal.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom

The Supreme Court  unanimously dismisses  SDG’s  appeal . Lord  Hodge (with whom Lord Neuberger,

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Against the  background  of the other relevant p rovisions of ICTA [ 18], the court  concludes  that section 
103 does not contain an implicit restriction so that the charge to tax on post -cessation receipts falls The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Squar e London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 only on the former trader whose trade was the source of the income [ 19]. There are  three reason s in 
support of this conclusion : 
 
 First, there is nothing in the wording of section 103(1) or (2) which necessitates such implication. 
The charge to tax is clear: where a trade has been permanently discontinued, corporation tax shall 
be charged on “sums ar ising from the carrying on of the trade…during any period before the 
discontinuance”. Section 103(1) required only that the sums “are received” after the discontinuance; 
it specified the source of the sums falling within the charge but imposed no further r estriction [ 20]. 
 
 Second ly, section 103 was designed to catch the “fruit” of the trade.  Its aim  was to make sure that 
sums which a person received, which arose from a discontinued trade and which were not 
otherwise taxed, were brought into a charge to tax.  No sound policy reason has been suggested for 
confining the cha rge to the former trader and his  personal representatives [ 21]. 
 
 Thirdly,  the neighbouring provisions of section 103  drew a distinction between the person 
chargeable to tax and the person who  had p reviously carried on the trade. This suggests  that the 
former  was not confined to the latter  [22-23]. 
 
The court  rejects SDG’s submission that the sum it received equivalent to the VAT Repayment did 
not have a former trade as its source, but was the result of an intra -group arrangement which was 
either a transfer for no consideration of that sum , or a transfer for no consideration of the rights to the 
VAT Repayment. Under section 103 of ICTA, the focus was on the original source of the receipt ; the 
arrangements within the Group as to the  specific company that was to receive the VAT Repayment 
did not alter that original source [ 24]. 
 
Section 106 of ICTA  also supports a wider interpretation of the scope of the section 103 charge to 
corporation ta x: section 106(1) quantifies the section 103 charge at the amount of the consideration or 
the market value of the rights to such sums when the former trader transfers its rights to those future 
receipts for value and the subsection imposes the charge on the former  trader [ 25]; and section 106(2) 
disapplies section 103 and substitutes another Case of Schedule D  only if the transferee company is 
carrying on the continuing business when it receives the fruits of the trade  which is deemed to have 
been discontinued  [26]. 
 
Applying this  analysis of sections 103 and 106 of ICTA to the facts of this case, the court  concludes 
that the Group’s affairs were organised such  that the  VAT Repayment was received by SDG as 
beneficial owner, receiving sums “arising from the carrying on of the trade” of the  companies making 
relevant supplies  during periods “before the discontinuance” and the sums were not otherwise 
chargeable to tax. The VAT Repayment accordingly is subject to a charge to corporation tax in the 
hands of SDG [ 28-31].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  Ms Kennedy’s  appeal . Lord Reed and Lord Hodge (with 
whom Lady Hale, Lor d Wilson and Lord Toulson agree) give the judgment of the court.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Reed and Lord Hodge provide guidance on the evidence of skilled  witnesses  under Scots law , 
addressing (i) admissibility [39-56]; (ii) the responsibilities of a  party’s legal team  [57]; (iii) the court’s 
policing of the performance of the expert’s duties [58-59]; and (iv) economy in litigation [60-61]. In 
the present case, the  expert witness  had experience and qualifications in health and safety [9]. His 
evidence  on factual matters was relevant and admissible . He had the necessary experience and 
qualifications to explain how anti -slip attachments reduced the risk of slipping [62-63]. His evidence 
on health and safet y practice was relevant [64]. Whilst some of his statements might  appear to be 
inadmissible expressions of opin ion on the respondents ’ legal duties , an experienced judge could treat 
the statements as opinion s as to health and safety practice, and make up his own mind on the legal 
question s [66]. The witn ess’s evidence provided a basis for the Lord Ordinary to determine whether 
the defenders had suitably and sufficiently evaluated the risks and identified the measures needed to 
protect health and safety [67]. 
 
The statutory case was based first on the Mana gement of Health and Safety at Work Regulations  1999 
(“the Management Regulations”) , which  implement Directive 89/391/EEC (“the Framework 
Directive”) , and under regulation 3(1) require a suitable and sufficient risk assessment  to be carried out 
[85-89], and secondly on the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992 (“the PPE The Supreme Court of t he United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Regulations”) , which  implement Directive 89/656/EEC (“the PPE Directive”) , and under regulation 
4(1) require suitable personal protective equipment to be provided to employe es who may be exposed 
to a risk to their health or safety while at work except to the extent that such risk has been adequately 
controlled by other means which are equally or more effective  [93-97].  
 
The most logical way to approach the issues was through  a consideration of the suitability and 
sufficiency of the risk assessment [89]. The appellant was exposed to a risk of slipping and falling on 
snow and ice whi ch was obv ious and was within the knowledge of the respondents, who had previous 
experience of h ome carers suffering such accidents each year. The risk had been identified in a 2005 
assessment, and risks of that general nature were also identified in a 2010 assessment [90]. No 
consideration had been given to the possibility of personal protective equ ipment . The precautions 
taken, in the form of advice  to wear appropriate footwear, did not specify what might be appropriate. 
The Lord Ordinary was entitled to conclude that there had been a breach of regulation 3(1) of the 
Management Regulations [92].  
 
The appellant was “at work” whilst she was travelling between the home of one client and that of 
another in order to provide th em with care. Contrary to the view of the Extra Division, t he words 
“while at work” in regulation 4(1) of the PPE Regulations , and  “whilst they are at work” in regulation 
3(1) of the Management Regulations , mean that the employee must be exposed to the risk during the 
time when she is at work. They do not refer to the cause of the risk [100] . The Directives encompass 
not only risks a rising specifically from the nature of the activities which the worker carries out, but also 
risks arising from the natural environment to which the worker is exposed whilst at work [102]. The 
Lord Ordinary found that anti -slip attachments were available w hich would have been suitable to 
reduce the risk of home carers slipping and falling on ice, and that the risk was not adequately 
controlled by other means which were equally or more effective. He was therefore entitled to conclude 
that there had been a br each of regulation 4(1) of the PPE Regulations [106] .  
 
In relation to the common law case , it was a mistake to view the appellant as being in the same 
position as an ordinary mem ber of the public. She  was required to visit clients in their homes in 
hazard ous weather conditions , whether or not the roads and footpaths in question had been treated. 
Her employers  were able (and obliged by statute) to consider the risks to her safety and the means by 
which those risks could be reduced [108]. A reasonably pruden t employer would  conduct a risk 
assessment so as to take suitable precautions to avoid injury to its employees . The duty to carry out a 
risk assessment wa s logically anterior to determining what precaution s a reasonable employer would 
take to fulfil its  common law duty of care [110]. The respondents were aware of a history of accidents 
each year and were aware that the consequenc es were potentially serious. Tho se circumstances were 
sufficient to require an employer taking reasonable care for the safety of i ts employees to inquire into 
possible means of reducing the risk. Upon such inquiry, or the carrying out of a proper risk 
assessment, on the evidence accepted by the Lord Ordinary the respondents would have learnt that 
attachments were available at a modes t cost to reduce the risk, and had been used by other employers 
in a similar position. The Lord Ordinary was entitled to conclude that the respondents were negligent 
in failing to provide the appellant with such attachments [112-113]. 
 
The Lord Ordinary ma de no express findings as to causation, other than that the appellant would have 
used attachment s if they had been provided. The concept of “suitability”, under regulation 4(1) o f the 
PPE Regulations, contained  a causal component: the equipment must adequa tely control the risk so far 
as wa s practicable. A risk would not be “adequately” controlled unless injury was highly unlikely [118] . 
In the circumstances, it was reasonable to infer that the failure to provide the anti-slip attachment s 
caused or materiall y contributed to the accident  [119].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeal , holding that  the driving must have be en at fault 
for a person to be convicted of aggravated vehicle taking under s12A of the Theft Act 1968. Lord 
Sumption gives the judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The reasoning in  R v Hughes cannot be distinguished, because the offences under s12A(2)(b) of the 
Theft Act 1968 and s3ZB of the Road Traffic Act 1988 are both drafted in terms which require a 
direct causal connection between the driving and the injury . [20-22; 30].  
 The Sup reme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Strict liability is typically imposed where the enactment is  regulator y or “qu asi-criminal” . Aggravated 
vehicle taking under s12A is n either: it is a serious crime, exposing defendants to the possibility of 
much longer maximum sentences . It imposes strict liability  only to the extent that  anyone who was 
party to the taking of the ve hicle (and  in the immediate vicinity at the time of the  injury ) commits the 
offence , whether or not he was driving at the time . The appellant’s driving explained how the vehicle 
came to be in the place where the accident occurred, but cannot be said to hav e caused it [23-29].  
 
The test is as set out in R v Hughes : there must be “ at least some act or omission in the control of the car which 
involves some element of fault, whether amounting to careless/inconsiderate driving or not, and which contributes in s ome 
more than minimal way to the death ” [30; 32 -3].

The Supreme Court  allows the appeal  on the Appellant’s application under the 1989  Act by a majority 
of 3:2  (Lord Clarke and Lord Sumption dissenting) on the basis that B remained  habitu ally resident in 
England on 13 February 2014.  Lord Wilson gives the lead judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Habitual residence  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Lord Wilson  (with whom  Lady Hale and Lord Toulson agree)  observes that two consequences flow 
from  the modern international primac y of the concept of a child’s habitual residence. First, it is not in 
the interests of children routinely to be left without a habitual residence [ 30]. Second, the English 
courts’ interpretation of the concept of habitual residence should be consonant with its international 
interpretation [ 31]. The present  case, however, involved a third aspect of the  concept  of habitual 
residence: the circumstances in  which a child loses his or her habitual residence  [32]. The traditional  
English law approach to this issue  is heavily dep endent upon parental intention.  In particular, i n In re J 
(A Minor) , Lord Brandon observed that a person may cease to be habitually re sident in a country in a 
single day if he or she leaves it with a settled intention not to return  and settle elsewhere  [33-34].  
 
Lord Wilson notes that the Supreme Court  in A v A  held that the English concept of habitual 
residence should be  governed by  the criterion set out in the CJEU  jurisprudence:  namely, that there be 
some degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment . This focuses  on the child’s 
situation , with parental intention  being merely  one relevant factor [35-38]. Lord W ilson identifies two 
points in  the CJEU jurisprudence  relevant to the issue of when habitual residence  is lost . First, the 
effect of Recital 12 to the Brussels II Regulation is that , where the interpretation of the concept of 
habitual residence can reasona bly follow two paths,  the courts should follow the path perceived better 
to serve the interests of children . Second, the  CJEU has indorsed the view that , although it i s 
conceivable  that a child  may have no habitual residence , this will only be in exception al cases [ 40-44].  
 
Lord Wilson concludes that the modern concept of a child’s habitual residence operates in such a way 
as to make it highly unlikely, albeit conceivable, that a child will be left without a habitual residence; the 
concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he or she loses 
their old one. Lord Brandon’s observation in In Re J  should no longer be regarded as correct, and 
Hogg J fell into error in being guided by it [ 45-47].   
 
Lord Wilson  therefore  states that the correct question is whether B had by 13 February 2014 achieved 
the requisite degree of disengagement from her English environment [ 48]. He concludes that, taken 
cumulatively, the factors pointing to the conclusion that B had not by 13 Febru ary 2014 achieved the 
requisite degree of disengagement compel the conclusion that she retained habitual residence in 
England  [49-50]. Accordingly, the Appellant’s application under the 1989 Act can and should proceed 
to substantive determination  by the Hi gh Court (Family Division)  [51].   
 
Lord Sumption  (dissenting)  considers that Hogg J  made no error of law and,  having heard and 
reviewed the evidence , was entitled to find that B lost her habitual residence in England on 3 February 
2014 [ 64-80]. Lord Clark e agrees  [89-95].           
 
Inherent jurisdiction  
 
Given the majority’s conclusion on habitual residence, it is unnecessary to decide whether the inherent 
jurisdiction can be exercised.  Lady Hale and Lord Toulson  observe that  none of the  reasons for 
caution when deciding whether to exercise the  inherent  jurisdiction  has much force in this case.  They 
consider that the jurisdiction is not confined to  exceptional circumstances ; it could  have been exercised

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  Mr Youssef’s appeal . Lord Carnwath gives the only 
judgment, with which Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Wilson and Lord Sumption agree.    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The court finds that the respondent’s 2005 decision to remove his hold on the proposal for the 
appellant’s designation by the Sanctions Committee was the exercise of prerogative powers for the 
conduct of foreign relations. This does not make it immune from judicial review, but the courts shoul d 
proceed with caution [24].  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London S W1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
On the first ground , torture -tainted evidence, the court finds that t he respondent’s decision  must be 
judged by reference to his reasons, which were untainted, and not by the reasons of the committee 
which were published in 2 010 [27]. Whilst there is no doubt as to the importance of the rules against 
torture and the use of torture -tainted evidence, these rules do not imply a duty on states to inquire into 
the possible reliance on torture -tainted evidence by other states, actin g alone or as part of an 
international organisation [29].  
 
On the second ground, absence of power, the court finds that there is statutory authority to satisfy the 
principle in Entick v Carrington that interference by the state with individual property ri ghts cannot be 
justified by the exercise of prerogative powers, unsupported by specific statutory authority. The 
requisite statutory authority is provided by EU Regulation 881, which was given legislative effect by 
the European Communities Act 1971 . The ca usative role played by the prior decision of the Sanctio ns 
Committee and the respondent  as a member  of the committee  does not affect this conclusion [34]. 
 
The appellant’s third  ground, that the standard of proof  of “reasonable grounds for suspicion”  is too 
low, is rejected. T he court h olds that the position of a decision -maker trying to assess risk in advance is 
very different from that of a decision -maker trying to determine whether someone has actually done 
something wrong. Designation has a “preventativ e” purpose  [50]. The Financial Action Task Force 
(FATF) recommendations relating to money -laundering and terrorist financing refer to the objective of 
freezing terrorist -related assets “based on reasonable grounds, or a reasonable basis, to suspect or 
believe” that the assets could be used to finance terrorist activity . A similar test of “whether there is 
sufficient information to provide a reasonable and credible basis for the listing”  was proposed  by the 
Ombudsperson in her report to the Security Council in January 2011  and reaffirmed by her in 2013 
[38-9]. The appellant’s reliance on the criticisms of a “reasonable suspicion” test by this court in 
Ahmed v HM Treasury (No. 2) [2010] UKSC 5 is rejected on the basis that the majority judgments  in 
Ahmed turne d principally on the interpretation of the United Nations Act 1946 , and that this court has 
the advantage  of more recent evidence  as to the current practice of the UN committee court [49]. 
 
The fourth ground is the standard of review.  The respondent accept ed in light of the approach in 
Kennedy  v Charity Commission [2014] UKSC 20  and Pham  v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] 
UKSC 19 , that the facts of the case are such that the review to be conducted will be “in accordance 
with common law prin ciples, incorporating notions of proportionality”, but submitted that this does 
not imply a shift to merits review [54]. The court finds that whilst there is support for the use of 
proportionality as a test in relation to interference with “fundamental rig hts”, in many cases the 
application of a proportiona lity test is unlikely to lead to a different result from traditional grounds of 
judicial review, particularly in cases involving national security, where a large margin of appreciation is 
accorded to the executive [56-7]. The court reject s the appellant’s submission that a full merits review 
was required, finding that the UN Security Council has entrusted member states , as members of the 
Sanction Committee , with determining whether the designation criteria  are met . It would be 
inconsistent with that regime for a national court to substitute its own assessment [58]. The court 
finds that whilst the Divisional Court was wrong to lay emphasis on an “irrationality” test,  the 
applicant had failed to identify any particular aspect of the reasoning which is open to challenge even 
applying a proportionality test  [59].  
 
The court holds that e ven if there were a flaw in the respondent’s 2005 decision, this of itself would 
not entitle the appellant to a remedy. Quashin g the decision would not have any substantive effect on 
the appellant’s present position, as it would not detract from the continuing effect of the Sanction 
Committee’s listing or its application in the United Kingdom through Regulation 881 [60].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal  against the refusal to maintain the anonymity order 
protecti ng the appellant .   It finds that t here is no presumption of anonymity and the question in High 
Court proceedings  relating to the compulsory powers under the MHA 1983 is whether an order for The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 anonymity is necessary in the interests of the patient. Such an o rder was necessary in the appellant’s 
interests in this case. Lady Hale gives the only subst antive judgment . 
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The rules governing privacy and anonymity in all civil proceedings in the High Court  are found in rule 
39.2 of the Civi l Procedure Rules [ 15]. The general rule that hearings should be held in public is subject 
to established exceptions in relation to whole classes of hearings such as those relating to children, 
which should normally be heard in private [ 17]. Most of the im portant safeguards secured by a public 
hearing can be achieved without the press publishing or the public knowing the identities of the people 
involved , but it is for the court and not the parties to balance the interests at stake [ 18]. 
 
It is necessary to  distinguish between ordinary civil proceedings in which a mental patient may be 
involved, and proceedings concerning the compulsory powers under the MHA 1983 [ 21]. For the latter 
there is a presumption of privacy and anonymity in the rules governing appli cations to the First -tier 
and Upper tribunals [ 24]. Similar rule s providing for anonymity  are in place for the Court of 
Protection, the other specialist jurisdiction dealing with people with mental disorders or disabilities 
[25]. As regards the High Court,  it was recognised by the House of Lords in  the leading case of  Scott v 
Scott [1913] AC 417 that the principle of open justice did not extend to proceedings relating to wards 
of court and to lunatics. The Court of Appeal in the present  case wrongly treated  this exception as 
limited to private law litigation concerned with the protection and administration of property, when in 
fact there  were already  statutory powers similar to the compulsory powers under the MHA 1983 at the 
time of the decision of the House  of Lords, and the judicial safeguards for patients under those 
statutes were also conducted in private [ 29].  
 
The closest analogy with the present case was with proceedings in the tribunals, which were concerned 
with risk as well as diagnosis when consid ering applications in respect of transferred prisoners and 
restricted patients [ 31]. The privacy rules in the tribunals were a proper and proportionate departure 
from the principle of open justice [ 32], as the hearings inevitably involv ed examination of co nfidential 
medical examination about the patient. Judicial review of the Secretary of State’ s decisions as to 
discharge of such patients wa s no different [ 33]. Fear of disclosure of confidential information might 
inhibit a patient from frank dealings with his medical team and from bringing proceedings to challenge 
his detention or treatment [ 34].  The question in all these cases was that set out in CPR 31.2(4), namely 
whether anonymity was necessary in the interests of the patient. There should not be a pre sumption in 
favour of anonymity in every case but a balance should be struck between the public right to 
information about decisions in respect of notorious criminals and the potential harm to the patient and 
all others whose treatment could be affected by  the risk of exposure [ 36]. 
 
The present case concerned a horrendous crime which caused incalculable distress to the families of 
the victims, who have statutory rights to be informed about the arrangements made for the discharge 
of the appellant should the y so wish [ 37]. The public interest in knowing how difficult and sensitive 
cases of this sort were decided was protected by holding a public hearing, even if the ide ntity of the 
patient concerned wa s not disclosed [ 38]. In this case t here was a risk to the  appellant from members 
of the public. He was much more likely to lead a successful life in the community if his id entity was 
not generally known [39]. Putting all these factors into the balance an anonymity order was necessary 
in the interests of the appe llant, without which there was a real risk that his long years of treatment and 
reintegration into the community would not succeed [ 40].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  both Ms Mirga’s and Mr Samin’s appeal s for reasons set 
out in a judgment given by Lord Neuberger (wi th which Lady Hale, Lord Kerr, Lord Clarke and Lord 
Reed agree) .    The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Submissions of the parties  
 
The Secretary of State contend ed that the Court of Appeal’s decisions were right. A t the time  she 
applied for it, Ms Mirga  was inelig ible for income support because she was a “person from abroad” , 
and could not claim to be  a “worker” as she was an A8 national who had not done 12 months’ 
employment and thus could not qualify under  the A8 Regulations . Even if the A8 Regulations did not 
apply, the Secretary of State argued, Ms Mirga would not have been a “worker” under the EEA 
Regulations  as she had not worked for  12 months before claiming income support  [36]. In respect of 
Mr Samin, the Council contended that he was not a “worker” within t he EEA Regulations because he 
is now incapable of work and had  not worked for 12 months in t he UK  [37]. 
 
In response  to these contention s, two arguments  were raised o n behalf of Ms M irga and Mr Samin . 
 
The first  argument  rested on the Treaty on the Functio ning of the European Union  (“the TFEU”). Ms 
Mirga contended t hat, given  her right to respect for family and private life under article 8 of the 
European Convention  on Human Rights , and given that sh e had been a worker, albeit not for the 
requisite period u nder the A8 Regulations (or the EEA Regulations),  she could not be removed from 
the UK ; accordingly, she contended,  her right of residence  under  article 21.1 of TFEU could not 
lawfully be cut back by restricting her right to income support as the Income Su pport Regulations 
purport to do  [38, 41]. Mr Samin argued that  refusal of housing assistance to him constituted unlawful 
discrimination contrary to article  18.1 of the TFEU  because such assistance would have been accorded 
to a citizen of the UK or a qualif ying member from another member state who was i n the same 
position as Mr Samin  [39, 42].  
 
Ms Mirga’s alternative argument was that, even if the Income Support Regulations could have the 
effect  for which the Secretary of State contended , it would only be  so if it could be shown that 
providing her with income support would be disproportionate – i.e. if  it would place an unreasonable 
burden on the UK social assistance system, and there has been no inquiry into that question  [38, 58]. 
To much the same effect,  Mr Samin’s alternative  argument was that the refusal of housing allowance 
to him could only be justified if it could be shown that the grant of such an allowance  would be 
disproportionate and there had been no inquiry into that question  [58]. 
 
The first i ssue: do the domestic Regulations infringe the appellants’ TFEU rights?  
 
The right accorded  to Ms Mirga  by article 21.1 of TFEU is qualified by the words “subject to the 
limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties and by the measures adopted to gi ve them effect”. 
In the present case, the “measu res” include  the Accession Treaty and  the 2004 Directive , and hence 
the A8 Regulations and the EEA Regulations respectively  [43]. A significant aim of  these measures  
was to ensure that EU nationals from one m ember state should not be able to exercise their rights of 
residence in another member state so as to become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance 
system. Further, any right of residence after three months can be subject to conditions, and EU 
nationals can be refused soci al assistance where appropriate  [44]. 
 
Whether  the Accession Treaty or  the 2004 Directive  applied , Ms Mirga has not done 12 months’ work 
in the UK, and therefore  cannot claim to be a “worker” , and sh e is not a jobseeker, self -empl oyed, a 
student or self -sufficient. Therefore she can be validly denied a right of residence in the UK and can be 
excluded from social assistance.  Article 21.1 of TFEU  therefore  cannot assist her [45].  
 
The article 18 right  claimed by Mr Samin  is limited to “the scope of the Treaties”, which means that it 
only comes into play where there is discrimination in connection with a right in the TFEU or another 
EU treaty. Further, the right is without prejudice to any special provisions contained in the Treaties.  
Therefore, Mr Samin’s argument fails for the sa me reasons that Ms Mirga’s does  [47]. 
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Examination of recent judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”), especially 
Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig [2015] All ER (EC) 1 and Case C -67/14 Jobcent er Berlin Neukolin v Alimanovic 
clearly  support this conclusion . [48-57] 
 
The second issue: the  arguments based on lack of proportionality  
 
The argument that  the determination s of the courts and tribunals below  in relation to Ms Mirga’s claim 
and Mr Samin’ s claim were  flawed because no consideration was given to the proportionality of 
refusing each of them social assistance is rejected.  The judgments of the CJEU relied on by the 
appellants do not support the argumen t [58-66]. On the other hand, the judgment  and reasoning in 
Dano , supported by the judgment in Alimanovic undermine the argument [66, 67, 71]. It is unrealistic to 
require an individual examination of each particular case, as is recognised by the jurisprudence from 
the CJEU  [68]. Where a national of another member state is not a worker, self -employed or a student 
and had no, or very limited , means of support and no medical insurance, it would undermine the 
whole thrust of the 2004 Directive if proportionality could be invoked to entitle that person  to have 
the right of residence and social assistance in another member state, save p erhaps in extreme 
circumstances  [69]. It would also place a substantial burden on a host member state if it had to carry 
out a proportionality exercise in every case where  the right or residence or the right against 
discrimination was invoked [69]. Even if there is a category of exceptional cases where proportionality 
would come into play, Mr Samin and Ms Mirga do not fall into it [70].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1 901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
S 40 BNA makes pro vision for the Secretary of State to deprive a person of citizenship if satisfied that 
the grant was obtained by means of ‘fraud, false representation or concealment of a material fact ’. 
There is a right of appeal to the First -tier Tribunal against most su ch deprivations in s 40A [7]. 
 
The original decision adopting the nullity approach, rather than a deprivation of citizenship, involved  
the purported grant of British citizenship to someone who was impersonating another real person ( R v 
Secretary of State f or the Home Department ex p Mahmood  [1981] QB 58). Subsequent cases, including R v 
Secretary of State for the Home Department ex p Akhtar  [1981] QB 46, Bibi v Entry Clearance Officer, Dhaka 
[2007] EWCA Civ 740 and t he present ones, expanded this approach t o persons adopting a false 
identity through which the characteristics needed to obtain citizenship were acquired [8-14].  
 
The Secretary of State considers  that the law took a wrong turning after Mahmood , and the nullity 
approach should only apply in imper sonation cases [15]. The subsequent cases were based on the 
principle that there is a category of fraud as to identity which is so serious that a purported grant of 
citizenship is of no effect, but had not articulated a clear definition of su ch fraud. This  uncertainty 
means the law i s difficult to  apply in practice and also gives  rise to a number of illogical and  
unsatisfactory consequences. The same principle  would also appear to nullify the grant of ILR, but the 
Secre tary of State has never contended for this [16-18]. 
 
The Supreme Court agrees with this reasoning. It follows that the decisions of the Court of Appeal in 
Akhtar  and Bibi must be overruled and the  present  appeals allowed by consent [19].

The Supreme Court unanimously d ismisses  the appeal . It holds that Parliament must have intended 
that the Crown should not be bound by the smoking ban, since it would otherwise have made express 
provision for it in the Act . Lady  Hale gives the only reasoned  judgment, with whi ch all the other 
justices agree.     
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The classic rule is that a statutory provision does not bind the Crown save by express words or 
‘necessary implication’  [22]. This i s so well established that many statutes will have been dra fted and 
passed on this basis. Any decision of the Supreme Court to abolish this rule or reverse the  
presumption would operate retrospectively. It should not therefore do so , although Parliament , 
perhaps with the assistance of the Law Commission, is urged t o give careful consideration to the 
merits of ab olishing the rule [35].  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 188 6/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
The rule is  not an immunity from liability, but a rule of statutory interpretation. The goal of  all 
statutory interpretation i s to discover the intention of the legislation, gathered from the words used in 
the statute in the light of their context and purpose. A ‘necessary implication ’ is one which necessarily 
follows from the express provisions of the statute construed i n their context, including its  purpose. It 
is not enough that a s tatute is intended for the public good, or that it would be even more beneficial 
for the public if the Crown were bound. It is not, however, necessary that the purpose of the 
legislation would be wholly frustrated if the Crown were not bound; it is enough if an important 
purpose of the statute would have been frustrated. The court may take into account the extent to 
which the Crown is likely voluntar ily to take action to achieve the purpose of the statute [36]. The te st 
to be applied in this case i s therefo re whether, in the light of the words used, their context and the 
purpose of the legislation, Parliament must have meant the Crown to be bound by the smoking ban in 
the Act [37]. 
 
There i s no hint in the government publications preceding the Act that the C rown would not be 
bound by the smoking ban. It is intended to protect workers and visitor s from the dangers of exposure 
to second -hand smoke when reliance on voluntary mea sures has  not proved effective, and o mitting 
Crown premises would deny statutory prot ection to many people [38]. There are significant 
differences between the enforcement of the smoking ban by environmental health officers under the 
Act and a voluntary ban on government premises , which can only be enforced through far less 
effective procee dings brought by individuals [39-40]. Notwithstanding these factors , however, there 
are powerful indicators in the language of the Act itself that the Crown i s not to be bound by the 
smoking ban:  
 
• The Act does not say the smoking ban binds the Crown,  as it could easily have done  [43]; 
• This contrasts with s imilar statutes, such as the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, which 
contain express provisions on how and to what extent they apply to the Crown [44-45]; 
• The Act itself has just such a provision in anot her Part, relating to the supervision of 
management and use of controlled drugs [46]; 
• Almost identical provision to that is also made in the statute enacting the Scottish equivalent to 
the smoking ban, which shortly preceded the Act [47]; and  
• Even if it wa s desirable for the smoking ban to bind the Crown, the legislation is quite 
workable without this. The Crown could do a great deal by voluntary action to fill the gap 
[49]. 
 
Accordingly , the fact that where Parliament did mean to bind the C rown in the Act,  it expressly said so 
and made tailored  provi sion, is conclusive of the question of its lack of  intention in relation to the 
smoking ban. With considerable reluctance, the Supreme Court therefore dismiss es the appeal [50].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Sumption gives the lead judgment, with which 
Lord Hughes agrees. Lady Hale gives a partially concurring judgment with which Lord Clarke and Lord 
Wilson agree. Lord Wilson also gives a partially concurring judgment , with which Lord Clarke agrees.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Before permission can be given for service of a claim form outside the jurisdiction, it is necessary for th e 
claimant to establish  that: (i) the case falls within at least one of the jurisdictional gateways in para graph  3.1 
of Practice Direction 6B (“6BPD”) to the Civil Procedure Rules  (“CPR”) , (ii) his or her claim  has a 
reasonable prospect of success , and (ii i) England and Wales is the proper place in which to bring the claim . 
Lady Brownlie’s contractual claim relies on a contention that “the contract… was made within the 
jurisdiction” (the gateway in  paragraph 3.1(6)(a) ), whereas her tortious claims rely on a  contention that 
“damage was sustained within the jurisdiction” (the gateway in  paragraph 3.1(9)(a) ) [3]. 
 
In order to satisfy the Court of such jurisdictional facts, a claimant must show a good arguable case  on the 
issue. This means: (i) that the claimant  must supply plausible evidence  for the application of the relevant 
jurisdictional gateway  in paragraph 3.1 ; (ii) that if there is an issue of fact about it, or some other reason for 
doubting whether the gateway  applies, the Court must take a view on the m aterial available if it can reliably 
do so; but (iii) the nature of the issue and the limitations of the material available at th is interim stage may 
be such that no reliable assessment can be made, in which case there is a good arguable case for the 
appli cation of the gateway if there is a plausible (albeit contested) evidential basis for it [4-7]. 
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The Supreme Court invited Holdings to  provide further  evidence , which clarifie d that at the material times 
the Cairo hotel had been owned by a company  unrelate d to Holdings  and operated by Holdings’  Egyptian 
subsidiary.  There is consequently  no reali stic prospect of Lady Brownlie establishing that she contracted 
with Holdings , nor of Holdings being  held liable for the driver’s negligence . It follows that her cla im 
against Holdings lacks reasonable prospect s of success  [13-15].  
 
It is therefore  unnecessary to consider  where the contract was made.  Lord Sumption adds (obiter) that the 
law governing that question  is artificial  but that its application may be unavoid able under the  current 
wording of para graph  3.1(6)(a)  [16]. Lady Hale  adds (obiter)  the Rule s Committee could consider a broader 
formulation of para graph  3.1(6)(a) [33]. 
 
In those circumstances the correct interpretation of the gateway in para graph  3.1(9)(a ) does not arise . 
Anything said on the subject is obiter  [17, 32] . The claim under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 has no 
prospect of success  because the 1976 Act has no application to a tort which is not governed by English 
law. The driver’s alleged negligen ce is governed by the law of Egypt [18, 32, 55] . The Court of Appeal was 
wrong to base its interpretation of para graph  3.1(9) on the Rome II Regulation, which is concerned with 
applicable law rather than jurisdiction [21-, 48-50, 57]. 
 
Lord Sumption  and Lo rd Hughes  would have held that the other tortious claims did not  fall within 
paragraph  3.1(9)(a) [17]. This is because  there is a fundamental difference  between the damage done to an 
interest which the law protects (in this case, bodily integrity) and subsequent  expenditure which is merely 
evidence of its amount [22-25]. The draft sman  of 6BPD could have provided that “damage” should extend 
to the financial or physical consequences of the damage, but nothing in the language suggests that he did 
so. Policy co nsiderations  strongly  suggest that that was not intended . In particular, (i) the current rules were 
intended to assimilate the test to that which applies in Brussels regulation cases, which has always 
disregarded the secondary consequences of physical dama ge; and (ii) if the test is satisfied by the 
occurrence of any of the subsequent physical or financial consequences of the damage in England, the 
result will in practice be to confer jurisdiction by virtue of the claimant’s place of residence [26-30]. 
 
Lady Hale , Lord Wilson and Lord Clarke consider Lady Brownlie’s tort claims  to fall within paragraph 
3.1(9)(a) insofar as they seek damages for  personal injury to herself and, as his executrix, to her late 
husband [56]. Lady Hale observes  that, under the CPR and its predecessors , the Court has always retained  
a discretion to refuse permission  to serve proceedings outside the jurisdiction  [34-39]. There is a consistent 
line of first instance decisions permitting  claim s in tort to be brought in England and Wales  if damage is 
suffered here a result of injuries inflicted abroad. The judges  in those decisions  carefully considered and  
correctly  rejected the arguments to the contrary  [40-47]. There is no reason to think that the authors of 
paragraph  3.1(9) were contem plating anything but  the ordinary and natural meaning of the word  “damage” . 
The various  judges who have held that “damage” refers to actionable harm  are supported by the approach 
of the New South Wales Court of Appeal towards a  similar jurisdictional rule [51]. Furthermore, damage 
can be suffered by the same person in more than one place and the distinction between direct and indirect 
damage is not easy to draw in all cases  [51-53]. 
 
Lord Wilson and Lord Clarke consider that the relevant jurisdictional rule s have widened as required by 
EU law; but it does not follow that those rules, in a claim unconstrained by EU law, should be narrowed to 
the size of the gateway set by EU law  [58-62]. Paragraph 3.1(9)(a) refers to “damage” rather than “the 
damage”  [63]. A narrow interpretation of the word “damage”, requiring claimants to litigate elsewhere, 
could  lead to injustice  [64]. It is questionable whether claims in which only a tenuous amount of damage is 
suffered in England and Wales will satisfy the separate test of whether that is the proper place in which to 
bring the claim  [57, 65] . The courts of Ontario and New South Wales  have a long -standing jurisdiction  to 
entertain claim s based only on the occurrence of secondary damages within those jurisdictions , which 
ought to allay fears that this interpretation would encourage abuse [66].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal . Lord Carnwath gives the judgment, with which 
Lady Hale, Lord Wilson, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd -Jones agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Court reviewed various statutory rules relating to the provision of  reasons for planning decisions , 
observin g that these rules are to be found in subordinate legislation and that it is hard to detect a 
coherent approach to their development. The three main categories of  planning  decision are:  (i) 
decisions of Secretaries of State and inspectors , (ii) decisions b y local planning authorities in The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.u k 
 connection  with planning permission , and  (iii) decisions, at any level, on applications for EIA 
developmen t [21-23].  
 
Special duties arise under the EIA Regulations where an application (as in this case) involves a 
developm ent which is “likely  to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of factors such 
as its nature, size or location”  (an “EIA development”) . Regulation 3(4)  provides that  decision -makers 
shall not grant planning permission , where the application involves an EIA development , without first 
taking the environmental information into consideration , and that they  must state in their decision that 
they have done so. Article 6.9 of the Aarhus Convention (Convention on Access to Information, 
Public Partici pation in Decision -making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters), to which the 
United Kingdom is a party, also requires each party to make accessible to the public the text of certain 
decisions involving an EIA , along with reasons and the consider ations on which it is based [31-34]. 
 
Where there is a legal requirement to give reasons , what is needed is an adequate explanation of the 
ultimate decision. The content of that duty should not in principle turn on differences in the 
procedures by which the decision  is arrived at. The essence of the duty , and the central issue,  is 
whether the information so provided by the authority leaves room for genuine doubt as to what it has 
decided and why [35-42]. 
 
The Court rejects DDC’s argument that a breach of th e EIA duty alone should be remedied by a mere 
declaration of the breach. DDC relied on R (Richardson) v North Yorkshire County Council [2004] 1 WLR 
1920  in which  the Court of Appeal remedied a failure to provide a statement of reasons  without 
quashing the decision , by ordering only that the statement be provided. However, in that case it was 
possible to take the planning committee as adopt ing the reasoning in  the officer’s report which had 
recommended granting permission  [46-49]. 
 
In view of the specific du ty to give reasons under the EIA regulations, it is unnecessary to address the 
common law  position . However, the particular circumstances of this case would, if necessary, have 
justified the imposition of a common law duty to provide reasons for the grant of permission. 
Planning law is a creature of statute, but the proper interpretation of the statute is underpinned by 
general common law principles, including fairness and transparency . It is appropriate for the common 
law to fill the gaps in the present system of rules, but its intervention should be limited to 
circumstances where legal policy reasons for it are strong  [50-60]. 
 
The meeting on 13 June 2013 occurred only days  after receipt of  the planning officers’  detailed  report , 
which  proposed  new and c ontroversial amendments . A decision -maker must not only ask himself the 
right question, but must take reasonable steps to acquaint himself with the relevant information to 
enable him to answer it correctly. Even if  there was pressure to reach a decision in this case , it seems 
unfortunate that the committee members did not apparently consider deferring detail ed discussion of 
the proposed amendments  [62-63]. 
 
A mere declaration of the breach of the EIA duty  is not a n appropriate or sufficient remedy . In the  
three years since the permission was issued, no attempt has been made to formulate the reasons so as 
to make good the admitted breach , perhaps underlining the difficulty of reconstructing the reasons of 
the committee on the basis of its minutes  alone . The recorded views of those members who supported 
the proposal do not indicate whether those views were shared by the majority, nor why the members 
felt able to reject the view of their own advisers without further investigation. Their omission of any 
legal mec hanism to secure the proposed economic benefits, in particular the hotel and conference 
centre, required explanation.  Furthermore, it was critical  to understand the basis of the members’ 
belief that the harm to the AONB could be “minimised ”, which conflict ed with the planning officers’ 
view that screening would be largely ineffective . The quashing order of the Court of Appeal is 
consequently affirme d and the appeal is dismissed  [61-69].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
As a preliminary issue, the Court was required to determine the precise nature of the discrimination 
claim which the Appellant wished to make  [15]. In this regard, the Court concluded that the Appellant’s 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 challenge was to the conduct of the Respondent  in bringing and pursuing disciplinary proceedings 
against her, not to an alleged state of affairs in which BME lawyers were more likely to be the subje ct of 
such proceedings. Therefore, the bringing and pursuit of the disciplinary proceedings must be the focus 
of the investigation in terms of section 7(5)(a) of the 1998 Act [16-21]. 
 
The question which then arose  in relation to the application of s ection  7(5)(a) was whether the bringing 
of disciplinary proceedings by the Respondent was to be considered a series of discrete acts or a single 
continuous act [22]. Section 7(5)(a) should not be read narrowly and must be capable of providing an 
effective and wo rkable rule for situations where the infringement of a Convention right arises from a 
course of conduct. Leaving a claimant to have recourse only to the discretionary reme dy in s ection 
7(5)(b) is inappropriate [23]. 
 
The all eged infringement of Convention  rights in this case arose from a single continuous course of 
conduct. The essence of the complaint made by the Appellant was the initiation and pursuit of the 
proceedings to their conclusion. It cannot have been the intention of Parliament that each step s hould 
be an “act” to which the one year limitation period should apply [29].  
 
Under s ection 7(5)(a) time begins to run from the date when the continuing act ceased, not when it 
began [30]. In determining  when the continuing act ceased , it was necessary to consider whether the 
Respondent’s conduct in proceedings before the Visitors should be considered as forming part of the 
same continuing act as its conduct in proceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal. In order to answer 
this quest ion, it was necessary to consider  the nature of the regulatory scheme and the precise features 
of the Respondent’s conduct [32-34]. Several features of the regulatory scheme and the Visitors’ 
jurisdiction, as applicable to the disciplinary proceedings agai nst the Appellant , led to the conclusion that 
the Respondent’s part in the proceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal and those before the Visitors 
should be regarded as part of a single continuing act [35].  
 
Therefore, the single continuing act in this  case continued until the Visitors allowed the Appellant’s 
appeal on 17 August 2012. The Appellant commenced  the present proceedings on 21  February 2013, 
within the period of one year beginning with the date on which the act complained of took  place, as 
required by s ection 7(5)(a) and the appeal should accordingly be allowed [39]. 
 
The Respondent asked the Court to uphold the Court of Appeal’s decision on the alternative ground 
that Warby J was wrong to hold that the Article 14 ECHR claim  of indirect discrimination  had real 
prospects of success.  The Respondent argued that this claim could have no real prospect of success 
without statistics sufficient to raise a potential  case of discrimination, general statements of 
disproportionate impact  being unlikely to be sufficient [41].  
 
The Court observed that it was “adventitious” that this point was before the Court [42]. However, the 
Appellant was entitled to rely upon a 2013 report into the Respondent’s complaint system which analysed 
data from  2007 -11, in conjunction with the unhappy history of the proceedings against her, as supporting 
her case that she had been the victim of indirect discrimination. The European Court of Human Rights 
had made clear that indirect discrimination can be proved w ithout statistical evidence [43].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The basic measure of damages is the sum which restores the claimant as closely as possible to the 
position that he would have been in if he had  not been wronged. That principle is qualified by various 
rules which  limit recoverable losses . Where a claimant  lends money , and but for a negligent valuation  
would not have done so , the basic measure of damages is the difference  between : (a) the position  the 
claimant would have been  in, had the defendant  not been negligent  and (b) the claimant’s actual position . 
This is the “basic comparison” discussed by Lord Nicholls in Nykredit Mortgage Bank plc v Edward Erdman 
Group Ltd (No 2) [1997] 1 WLR 1627. The b asic comparison is  typically between : (a) the amount of 
money lent by the claimant, plus interest on that money and (b) the value of the rights acquired under 
the loan agreement plus the true value of the overvalued property  [6].  
 
It is assumed in this appeal that Tiuta would not have entered into the Second Facility , had De Villiers  
not negligently undervalued  the security  property . Tiuta would have  still entered into the First Facility , 
but would not have lost the new money advanc ed under the Second Facility . Whereas the  Deputy High 
Court Judge held that Tiuta’s losses were limited to that new money , the majority of the Court of Appeal 
held that the judge failed to take into account that the Second Facility was structured so as to  pay off the 
indebtedness under the First Facility . The majority consequently  held that  the basic measure of  Tiuta’s 
loss was: (a) the sums  advance d under  the Second Facility , less (b) the value of Tiuta’s  rights  under the 
Second Facility plus  the true value of the security  [7-8].  
 
The Supreme  Court disagrees  with that approach . The fact that the advance under the Second Facility  
was used  to pay off  indebtedness under the First Facility does not require the Court to ignore the fact 
that Tiuta  would have lost the sums which had been outstanding  under the First Facility in any event . 
The basic comparison envisaged in Nykredit  assumes that, but for the negligent valuation, the claimant 
would  still have had the money which the negligent valuation  caused  him to lend. In this case Tiuta 
would not have had that money , because it had already lent it under the First Facility [9]. 
 
It is irreleva nt, for the purposes of  the basic comparison  discussed  in Nykredit , that the valuer  might  have 
contemplated being liable  for the full amount of the advances under the Second Facility. The 
foreseeability of loss is not relevant to the basic comparison . Various legal filters may result in the valuer 
being liable for less than the difference calculated under the ba sic comparison . However, the valuer 
cannot be liable for more than the difference which his negligence has made simply because he 
contemplated that he might be liable in circumstances other than those which actually came about  [10]. 
 
Tiuta  argued that the use of the advance under the Second Facility to discharge the  indebtedness under 
the First Facility was a collateral benefit to Tiuta , which need not be taken into account when calculating 
Tiuta ’s loss  [11]. The Supreme Court rejects that argumen t. Generally,  where a claimant has received 
some benefit attributable to the events which caused his loss, it must be taken into account in assessing 
damages unless the benefit  is collateral . Collateral benefits are generally “ those whose receipt arose 
independently of the circumstances giving rise to the loss ” [12]. The discharge  of the existing 
indebtedness was not a collateral benefit. First, the refinancing part of the Second Facility  was neutral in 
its effect, rather than beneficial: it  both increased Titua’s exposure and reduced its loss under the First 
Facility by the same amount. Secondly, the terms of the Second Facility required the indebtedness under 
the First Facility to be discharged, so that outcome was not collateral to the Second Facility [13]. 
 
The appeal is therefore allowed. These reasons are sensitive to these facts, including those which have 
been assumed for the purposes of the appeal . Subject to any submissions that may be made about the 
exact form of relief, the order of the Deputy Hig h Court Judge  will be restored [15].

The Supreme Court unanimously dism isses the appeal . Lord Mance  gives the judgment  with whom t he 
remaining six Justices agree . The 2012 Act does not breach EU law. Minimum pricing is a 
proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The CJEU’s Judgment  
The is sues have to be examined in light of the guidance given by the CJEU: [5]. Advocate General  Bot 
(‘the AG’)  and the CJEU both assimilated the analysis of proportionality under articles 34 and 36 
TFEU and under the Single CMO Regulation . The AG conduct ed a three-stage proportionality 
analysis : (i) appropriateness, (ii) necessity and (iii) a balancing of interests . The CJEU , in contrast , 
conducted a two -stage analysis : (i) appropriateness and (ii) necessity , but appears to have subsume d an 
element involving a balancing of interests into the second stage of analysis: [9] and [15] . The CJEU The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 concluded  that where a national court examines national legislation in the light of the justification 
relating to the protection of health under article 36 TFEU it is bound to examine objectively whether it 
may reasonably be concluded from the evidence submitted by the Member State concerned that the 
means chosen are appropriate for the attainment of the objectives pursued and whether it is possible 
to attain those objectives by  measures that are less restrictive of the free movement of goods and of 
the CMO : [13]-[14]. 
 
The issues  
The respondents accept that minimum pricing will affect the market and EU trade in alcohol. The 
issue is therefore whether the respondents can justify the EU market interference under article 36 
TFEU and the parallel principles governing wine under the CAP and Single CMO Regulation: [3]-[4] 
and [18]. The appellants accept the legitimacy and appropriateness of the objective pursued by the 
respondents.  The parties were not however agreed as to the precise implications or qualifications of 
the objective : [18]. 
 
The objectives pursued by minimum pricing  
The objective as it was put before the CJEU was two -fold: ‘reducing, in a targeted way, both the 
consumptio n of alcohol by consumers whose consumption is hazardous or harmful, and also, 
generally, the population’s consumption of alcohol’: [19]. However, the objective is more refined  than 
might appear [20]. The aim is not that alcohol consumption be eradicated o r that its costs should be 
made prohibitive for drinkers. The aim  is to strike at alcohol misu se and overconsumption manifesting 
themselves in particular in the health and social problems suffered by those in poverty  in deprived 
communities: [20]-[28].  
 
Less restrictive measures to achieve the same aim 
The appellant s’ submission that an excise or tax would be a less restrictive and equally effective way of 
achieving the government’s objectives is rejected. The Supreme Court is ready to accept, contrary to 
the view on which the courts below proceeded, that the relevant EU directives (Council Directive 
92/83/EEC, Council Directive 92/84/EEC and Council Directive 2008/118/EC)  would permit 
additional excise duties or VAT levied at different rates by references to narrowly defined bands of 
alcoholic strength: [38]-[45]. Nevertheless and  in agreement with the Lord Ordinary, minimum 
pricing targets the health hazards of cheap alcohol and the groups most affected in a w ay that an 
increase in excise or  VAT  does not . The latter would be felt across the board in relation to the whole 
category of goods to which it applie d and unnecessarily affect groups which are not the focus of the 
legislation : [34]-[37]. Second, in agreement with the Lord Ordinary, minimum pricing is easier to 
understand and simpler to enforce. It would not be open to absorption (e.g. by selling alcohol below 
cost in order to attract other business onto their premises): [46].  
 
The lack of market impact analysis and balancing under proportionality  
It is unclear h ow far an objective , which is reasonable and can only be achieved in one way, can or 
should be measured against an assessment of any damage which giving it effect might cause to the 
ordinary operation of the EU market . [47]. But the CJEU’s refusal to endorse the AG’s third stage 
enquiry is an indication that the matter should be treated very lightly [48]. The comparison to be 
undertaken is between two incomparable values: (i) health and (ii) the market and economic impact on 
producers, wholesale rs and retailers of alcoholic drinks across the EU. The courts  should not  second -
guess the value which a domestic legislator put s on health. As such, there is limited scope for the 
criticism made by the appellants about the lack of EU market impact evidenc e [48]. An analysis of the  
market and competition impact  material that is available demonstrates  that the impact will be minor : 
[50]-[62]. The Sunset Clause indicating the  provisional  nature of the Regime  is a significant f actor in 
favour of upholding it : [63]. The submission that the Scottish Government should have gone further 
than it did to assess market impact is not realistic: [63].

The Sup reme Court unanimously dismisses  the trustees’  appeal.  Lord Hodge gives the lead judgment 
with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In Morrison v ICL  [2014] UKSC 48 , the Supreme Court determined that, in terms of s11(3) of the 1973 
Act, the creditor needed to be aware only of the occurrence of the loss or damage and not of its cause 
[17] but in that case the Court was not required to address the question raised by th is appeal i.e. whether 
under s11(3) the creditor must be able to recognise that he  or she  has suffered some form of detriment 
before the prescriptive period begins. This appeal raises the question of whether s11(3) starts the 
prescriptive clock when the cr editor is aware that he or she has spent money (e.g. on a professional 
advisor) but does not know that that expenditure will be ineffective [18].  
 
The phrase “loss, injury or damage” must be interpreted consistently throughout s11 of the 1973 Act . 
[19-20]. It therefore follows that s11(3) does not postpone the start of the prescriptive period until a 
creditor of an obligation is aware , actually or constructively , that he or she has suffered a detriment in 
the sense that something has gone awry which render s the creditor poorer or otherwise at a disadvantage 
[21]. This approach may be harsh to a creditor where he or she is aware of incurred expenditure but not 
that it entails the loss . However,  the alternative approach suggested by the trustees would create 
uncertainty and a requirement for awareness of a head of loss would involve knowledge of the factual 
cause of the loss, which is an interpretation rejected in  Morrison [22].  
 
Any understanding on the part of the trustees that the expenditure they incurred in pursuing the claim 
in the Scottish Land Court would ultimately be recovered from the tenant when their claim  was 
successful was irrelevant . On an objective assessment, t he trustees suffered loss on 10 November 2005 
when they did not obtain vacant posses sion.  At that moment, the prescriptive period began to run under 
s11(1) unless it co uld be postponed by s11(3). T here was no postponement under s11(3) because the 
trustees were aware that  they had suffered detriment when they did not obtain vacant possess ion on 10 
November 2005. In any event, they were actually or constructively aware that they had incurred legal 
expenses  to obtain such possession by 17 February 2006. The trustees did not begin proceedings until 
17 May 2012. It follows that the respondents ’ obligation to make reparat ion had by that time prescribed  
[24].  
 
Whilst this conclusion may lead to hard cases  being common, there are live proposals for law reform. 
Following a Scottish Law Commission report, the First Minister of Scotland announced on 5 September 
2017 that the Scottish Government intended to bring forward a Bill to reform the law of prescription  in 
Scotland.  It will be for the Scottish Parliament to decide whether the Commission’s proposals for reform 
of the discoverability test in s11(3) of the 1973 Act should be adopted [25].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Section 42 TMA, unless otherwise provided, has effect in relation to a claim for relief. Section 42(2) 
provides that , where HMRC has given notice to a person requiring him to make and deliver a tax return , 
a claim for relief must be included in that tax return. In the case of a partnership, certain types of claim 
for relief (including the  type of  claim made in this case) shall be made, where section 42(2) applies, in a 
partnership return [14-15]. Schedule 1 B to the TMA applies where (as in this case ) relief is sought for a 
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 loss incurred in a later year (“Year 2”) by carrying it back to an earlier year (“Year 1”) . According to 
paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 1B, section 42(2) is disapplied to such a claim. This di sapplication means that 
a claim may be made under Schedule 1A notwithstanding that HMRC have required the provision of a 
tax return  [17-20]. 
 
Enquiries into claims under Schedule 1A are subject to time limits [21]. The appellants  asserted that 
their claims were governed only by Schedule 1A because they were “stand -alone ” and the fact that 
HMRC did not open an enquiry within the requisite time limit in Schedule 1A means that th eir claims 
became unchallengeable. This assertion was incorrect becaus e of the provisions of the TMA which 
specify what a taxpayer must include in his return [22]. 
 
The disapplication of section 42(2) to claims falling within Schedule 1B does not mean that the taxpayer 
is released from the requirement to make the claim (i.e.  a claim for relief involving two or more years) 
in his tax return in Year 2. Section 8(1) TMA imposes this requirement [20]. Section 8 sets out what a 
person must produce when given a notice to make and deliver a tax return . Under section 8(1)(a), the 
person is required to provide information needed “for the purpose of establishing” the amount to which 
that person is chargeable to income tax . This will include the person’s share of partnership income or 
losses for the period which falls within the year of assessment [23]. A person must therefore include in 
the return for Year 2 his share of the losses of a partnership, of which he was a partner, which have been 
stated in a relevant statement relating to Year 2 [24]. 
 
If a taxpayer wished to claim to offset all of his share o f partnership losses in Year 2 against his other 
income in Year 2 by invoking section 380(1)(a) of ICTA, he would have to include that claim in his 
return for Year 2 [27]. If a taxpayer wished to carry back part of the losses incurred in Year 2 to set off 
against his liability to income tax in respect of Year 1 by invoking section 380(1)(b) of ICTA, he would 
also have to make the claim in his return for Year 2.  The information required as part of a taxpayer’s 
return for Year 2 will include  both the relief which is claimed in the return and that which he has already 
received (for instance, any relief already received under Schedule 1A) as that information is necessary 
“for the purpose of establishing” the amounts in which the taxpayer is cha rgeable to income tax for that 
year of assessment (section 8(1)) [28-29]. 
 
HMRC is empowered to  enquire into anything contained in the return, or required to be contained in 
the return , and was  therefore empowered (under section 9A TMA) to enquire into the  appellants’ carry 
back claims contained in their Year 2 tax returns. HMRC were not required to institute an enquiry under 
Schedule 1A in order to challenge the appellants ’ claims [30].  
 
HMRC by opening an enquiry into the partnership tax returns were dee med to have opened an enquiry 
into the partners’ personal tax returns in respect of Year 2  [32]. The partnerships appealed against the 
conclusions and amendments made by the closure notices following completion of HMRC’ s enquiries . 
The partnership settlement agreement made on 22 August 2011 had the same consequences as if the 
Special Commissioners (now the First Tier Tribunal) had determined the appeal in  the manner set out 
in the agreement [33]. This deemed decision empowered HMRC to amend the appellants ’ personal tax 
return s (section 50(9) TMA). Section 59B(5)(b) TMA provides for the payment by the taxpayer of sums 
payable as a result of such an amendment. Therefore, the amendment of the appellants ’ return s (by 
letters dated Septem ber to November 2011) was lawful and the judicial review challenge fails [35-36]. 
The decision of the Supreme Court in Cotter v Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs  [2013] 
UKSC 69  gives no support to the appellants  in this appeal  [37].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Carnwath gives the lead judgment, with which 
Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson and Lord Sumption agree. Lady Hale gives a concurring judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In Zambrano and subsequent cases , the reasoning of the CJEU  turned solely  on the risk that the dependents  of 
Zambrano carers might be  forced to leave the EU,  thereby  being deprived  of the enj oyment of their rights as EU 
citizens.  That Zambrano right of residence is exceptional and is not triggered merely by the desirability of keeping 
the family together . It is not a right to any particular quality of life or standard of living [8-15]. 
 
It was  argued  on behalf of Mrs HC that  in EU law , once a right of residence is established , the Zambrano carer  is 
automatically  entitled to the same social security assistance as nationals of  the host state . That argument  relied The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 on the judgment of the CJEU  in Baumbast v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] ECR I – 7091, as 
followed in Ibrahim v Harrow London Borough Council and Teixeira v Lambeth Borough Council (Joined Cases C -310/08 
and C -480/08)  [16-20]. 
 
This Court rejects  the analogy with those cases  for two reasons . First, those cases concerned whether rights of 
residence were subject to conditions derived from EU law. The rights asserted in those cases were not limited 
by domestic law. Conversely  the issue in this case is  whether the Regulati ons, which limit  Mrs HC’s entitlement 
to assistance , comply  with EU law. Second, the argument  that a right of residence triggers a right to equ al 
treatment under EU law relies  on article 21 of the Charter . This  begs the question of whether the Charter 
applie s to this case  at all [21]. 
 
According to article 51 of the Charter, the Charter applies to EU member states only when they  are 
implementing EU law. As a result, the test for the applicability of the Charter  is not whether Mrs HC was 
personally within the scope of EU law ; it is whethe r the Regulations  were implementing  EU law  [22-28]. EU 
law requires no more  for the children of a Zambrano carer than the practical support necessary for them  to 
remain in the EU. It is common ground that the limited  financial support provided to Mrs HC and her children 
is suf ficient for them to remain . It follows that  Mrs HC cannot rely on the Charter to establish a right to  further 
financial assistance  [5, 28 -29]. 
 
The measures adopted by the UK do not amount to unlawful discr imination under  article 14 of  the ECHR . 
Discrimination on the b asis of immigration status is an accepted part of EU and national law and cannot in itself 
give rise to an issue under article 14. Insofar as  Mrs HC  relies  on differences between her  treatment  as a 
Zambrano carer  specifically  and the treatment of others , such differences only  reflect  the rules of  EU law which 
created her Zambrano carer  status . In any event, the European Court of Human Rights has accepted that the 
allocation of public funds in th e social security context is primarily  a matter for national authorities , provided 
that allocations  are not “manifestly without reasonable foundation .” The objectives underlying the Regulations  
cannot be said to fall outside that wide margin of discretion allowed to national governments [31-32]. 
 
No issue arises in the appeal as to the scope of the local authority’s duties under section 17 of the Children Act 
1989, but that provision is now  an important aspect of the government’s response to the Zambrano principle. 
Section 17 confers a duty on local authorities  to promote the we lfare of the children in their area and, insofar  as 
consistent with that, to promote  the upbringing of su ch children by their families  [33-34]. In this case, the  duty 
arises from a re sponsibility imposed by EU law, but the allocation of that responsibility as between central and 
local government is a matter of domestic law only . That does nothing to diminish the importance of the duty  
under section 17 . It is ap propriate to provide guid ance at  a national level for the various local authorities 
discharging that duty  [36-37].  
 
In her concurring judgment, Lady Hale  adds that a local authority reviewing the needs of the children for the 
purposes of section 17 will no doubt consider: (i) the need to promote  actively  the welfare of the childre n, when 
exercising various statutory powers ; (ii) the fact that these children are British , with the right to remain here for 
the rest of their lives;  (iii) the impact on the pro per development of the chi ldren which would follow  if they 
were denied a level of support equivalent to their peers  [43-46]. The other members of the Court agree  with 
those observations  [37]. 
 
In Lady Hale ’s view  the administration of section 17 , unlike the Regulations,  could be sa id to implement  EU law 
by enabling the chil dren to remain in the UK.  If the Charter were applicable  to the administration  of section 17 , 
it might be possible to regard discrimination against  the children of  Zambrano carers in that context as falling 
within  article 21 of the Charter.  In that case,  the justifications  presently  offered on behalf of  the Secretary of 
State  would be  unimpressive . But section 17 is one way of providing these children with what they need and 
deserve. The availability of alternative s, which are in some ways preferable , does not mean that the UK is in 
breach of EU law [48-52].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . The Retention and SCR policies are not 
unlawful  under the GRA, the HRA or the EA . Lady Hale gives the only substantive judgment.     
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lawfulness under t he GRA  
 
S 9 GRA provides that where a GRC is issued a person’s gender ‘becomes for all purposes ’ the 
acquired gender.  It does not rewrite history or require the previous state of affairs to be expun ged 
from official  records, but other sections offer additional protection against inappropriate official 
disclosure of that prior history  [23-25]. The Retention and SC R policies are no t therefore inconsistent 
with or prohibited by any provision of the GRA  [26]. 
 
Lawfulness under t he HRA  
 
The Retention and SCR policies do constitute a very  serious  interference with the rights of transgender 
people  to respect for their private life protec ted by article 8 ECHR  [31]. The justifications relied on by 
the DWP  – the need to retain information for the time being for the purposes of calculating state 
pension rights, and to identify and detect fraud – are legitimate [34] and rationally connected wi th the 
policies [35]. The question is whether the policies are pro portionate. In carrying out the  balancing 
exercise it is relevant that front line staff will only rarely have to access the CIS, that the DWP has 
been engaging with C over m any years to try to understand and cater for her concerns,  that it is no 
simple matter to modify existing computer systems designed to cater for vast numbers of customers, 
which interact with one another in complex ways, and that it is not possible to make further 
adjustme nts to the CIS without inordinate expense. It is not for the court s to administer the benefits 
system [36].  
 
The Retention policy is therefore  a proportionate means of achieving its legitimate aims [37].  The SCR 
policy cannot  be considered in isolation fr om it. It has  the legitimate aim of protecting the privacy of 
those customers who need and want it. The problems associated with it are inevitable if access to the 
CIS is to be restricted. It too is justified [38]. 
 
Lawfulness under the EA  
 
There is no dir ect discrimination on the ground of g ender reassignment  [43]. The details of all 
customers who change their names and titles are recorded on the CIS [42]. Transgender customers 
who need and want it are treated differently under the SCR policy [41]. They ar e not treated less 
favourably as a result of their transgender status.  
 
The claim of indirect discrimination also fails. The court accepts that gender reassignment changes 
one’s identity at a much deeper level than name changes for other reasons. However the SCR policy is 
a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate  aim for the purposes of s  19(2)(d) EA and for the 
same reasons any discrimination is justified for the purpose s of article 14  of the ECHR  [44].

The Supreme Court dismisses  the appeal . Lord Kerr gives the judgment with which all oth er members

reasons.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
It is accepted that D r Michalak could seek judicial review of the decisions that are alleged to constitute 
discrimination. The issue is whether the availability of judicial review comes within section 120(7) of the 
2010 Act. This depends on two requirements  being satisfied : (i) whether judicial review can be described 
as a “proceeding in the nature of an appeal” and (ii) whether it is available “by virtue of an enactment” 
[13]. 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
The Employment Tribunal was designed to be a specialised forum for the resolution of disputes betwee n 
the employee and employer, with the power to award a comprehensive range of remedies. Where 
Parliament has provided an alternative route of challenge to a decision through an appeal or an appeal -
like procedure, however, it makes sense for the appeal procedure to be confined to that statutory route. 
This avoids the risk of expensive and time -consuming satellite proceedings and is convenient for both 
the appellant and respondent.  Employment tribunals should be prepared to examine critically whether 
statutory appeals are available, and where they are, should strike out proceedings before them.  This 
rationale only applies where the alternative route is capable of providing an equivalent means of redress , 
however.  [16-18].  
 
Conventionally, an “appeal” is a procedure which entails a review of an original decision in all its aspects 
– an appeal body may thus examine the basis on which the original decision was made, assess the merits 
of the conclusions reached and, if it disagrees, substitute its own  view. Judicial review, by contrast, is a 
proceeding in which the legality of or procedure by which a decision is reached is challenged . It cannot 
partake of the nature of an appeal – the remedy available on a judicial review application in circumstances 
such as t he present is a declaration that the decision is unlawful or that the decision be quashed. The 
court cannot substitute its own decision for that of the decision -maker  and, in that sense,  the decision 
of the GMC could not be reversed . An appeal in a discri mination case must confront directly the 
question whether discrimination has taken place, not whether the GMC had taken a decision which was 
legally open to it.  [20-22]. 
 
The origins of judicial review lie within the common law and it is not a procedure wh ich arises “by virtue 
of” any statutory source – section 31 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 did not establish judicial review as 
a procedure, but rather regulated it . If Parliament had intended that judicial review was within the scope 
of the procedures contemplated by section 120(7), one would expect that it would have provided for it 
expressly  [32-33, 35]. 
 
Lord Mance agrees with Lord Kerr but adds that he would not necessarily limit the ability of judicial 
review to cater for a close examination of a c laim on its merits – in appropriate circumstances, judicial 
review may lead the court to a conclusion that there exists only one possible outcome of a properly 
conducted le gislative or executive decision -making process. In this situation, however, the Empl oyment 
Tribunal offers the natural means of recourse and there is no need to strain the ordinary understanding 
of the concept of “appeal” to embrace judicial review [37-38].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Littlewoods’ cross -appeal on the first issue , and allows  
HMRC’s appeal on the second issue. Lord Reed and Lord Hodge give a joint judgment , with which the 
rest of the Court agrees.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The firs t issue : whether the common law claims are excluded by the 1994 Act  
 
Section 78 of the 1994 Act impliedly excludes the claims made by Littlewoods, as a matter of English 
law, for the following reasons.  
 
First, the scheme created by section 78 is inconsistent with the availability of concurrent  common law 
claims to interest. The right to interest in section 78 is subject to certain limitations , includ ing (i) section 
78(1) , which  limits HMRC’s liability to pay interest to cases of error by HMRC [31]; (ii) s ection 78(3), 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 and the provisions to which it refers, which determine that the interest rate is calculate d on a simple 
rather than a compounded basis [32]; (iii) s ection 78(11) , which  sets the applicable limitation period , 
which  is shorter than th e limitation period that would apply to a common law claim  [33]. These 
limitations  would be defeated and rendered effectively pointless  if it were possible for the taxpayer to 
bring a common law claim [34].   
 
Second , section 78 states that t he liability to pay interest under that section applies “if and to the extent that 
[the Commissioners] would not be liable to do so apart from this section” . On a literal meaning, this would permit 
a common law claim  for interest  to be made outside section  78. At the time section 78 was enacted, 
however, the type of common law claim made by Littlewoods in the present case had not yet been 
recognised in law, and was thus not contemplated by Parliament when it enacted the legislation. It cannot 
have been Parl iament’s intention that a common law claim would be permitted in any case where an 
amount was paid under section 80, as this would render section 78 a dead letter, and would fatally 
compromise the statutory scheme. As such, the reservation in section 78(1)  (italicised above) cannot be 
read literally. It must be construed as referring only to statutory liab ilities to pay interest , not to a 
common law liability for interest  [34-39] 
 
The second issue : whether EU law requires the payment of compound interest  
 
The CJEU  judgment does not require reimbursement of the losses constituted by the unavailability of 
money. The CJEU has given member state courts a discretion to provide reasonable redress in the form 
of interest in addition to the principal sum . The lower courts  in this case  read too much into the phrase 
“adequate indemnity” in the CJEU judgment [51, 70] . Three reasons support this view.  
 
First, when read as a whole, the CJEU’ s judgment, which directly address es the issue in this case, is clear.  
The judgmen t can be analysed in  the following  three parts: (i) the re is a  general entitlement to interest 
on tax levied in breach of EU law  (paras 24 -26 of the CJEU judgment) ; (ii) it is for member states to 
determine whether the interest rate is simple or compound, subject to  the principle of effectiveness  
which requires  that the calculation of that interest  should amount to reasonable redress  or an “adequate 
indemnity”  for the taxpayer’s loss  (paras 27 -29 of the CJEU judgment) ; and (iii) the suggestion that 
interest  which is over 125% of the principal sum might be such reasonable redress  (para 30 of the CJEU 
judgment)  [52-59, 71]. 
 
Second , there is a  widespread practice among EU  member states of awarding taxpayers simple interest 
on the recovery of taxe s which were unduly paid. If the CJEU were seeking to outlaw that practice,  one 
would have expected clear words to that effect [60, 72]. 
 
Third , the prior and subsequent case law of the CJEU is consistent with  the principle that there is an 
EU right to inte rest, but that the rate and method of calculation of interest are matters for the member 
states. Case C -271/91 Marshall , where the CJEU held that interest had to be awarded to take account of 
the diminution in value of money over time , was a case  about the  measure of compensation for sex 
discrimination , and is distinguishable from the present case  [61-69].  
 
In summary, the payment of interest in this case cannot realistically be regarded as having deprived 
Littlewoods of an adequate indemnity [73].  
 
The other issues raised in the appeal do not arise for decision, as they would arise only if Littlewoods 
were successful on either of the first two issues [16].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisse s the appeal , upholding  the decision that there was no 
violation of article 5(1)(a) . Lord Reed gives the lead judgment, with which the rest of the Court agrees.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Previous decisions on Article 5(1) (a) 
In James v United Kingdom  (2013) 56 EHRR 12  (“James ”), the European Court of Human Rights ( ECtHR ) 
applied the general principle that article 5(1) requires the conditions of detention to be consistent with 
the purpose of the detention . Based on that principle the court concluded that after the punishment part  
(the “tariff period”) of an indeterminate sentence for public protection (“IPP”) has been served and the 
prisoner remains in detention for reasons of public protection, a real opportunity for rehabilitation 
should be provided  [8-18]. 
  
The Supreme Court  (“UKSC”)  in R (Kaiyam) v Secretary of State for Justice  [2014] UKSC 66  (“Kaiyam ”) 
accepted there was an obligation to provide life and IPP prisoners with a real opportunity for 
rehabilitation, but held this was not imposed by article 5(1).  Rather, the duty was an ancillary duty in the 
overall scheme of article 5  and existed throughout  the prisoner’s detention. James  was not part of a clear 
and constant line of decisions. The UKSC  was concern ed that the approach in James might give prisoners 
a right  to immediat e release under the Convention [22-25].  
 
The ECtHR  in Kaiyam v United Kingdo m (2016) 62 EHRR SE 13 rejected the article 5 (1) complaint in 
Kaiyam  as inadmissible  on the basis that article 5(1)(a) does not require a real opportunity for 
rehabilitation during the tariff period, since this represents the punishment part of the sentenc e. The 
ECtHR  declined to adopt the UKSC’s analysis, and adhered  to the approach in James . On the facts of 
Kaiyam , a real opportunity for rehabilitation had been provided to the applicants  [32-36]. 
 
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  Whether the UKSC should align its approach with the ECtHR  
The question of whether the obligation to provide rehabilitation opportunities arises under article 5(1)  
(as the ECtHR  held in James and Kaiyam ), or is immanent in article 5 as a whole  (as the UKSC held in 
Kaiyam ), affects the substance of the obligation , including : the period during which  the obligation  applies, 
the standard of the duty, and the weight to be placed on the  Secretary of State’s assessment of what 
amounts to a reasonable opportunity  [38-41]. 
In light of this, t he UKSC’s approach in Kaiyam  has resulted in the imposition of a duty on the prison 
authorities which is significantly different from, and more demanding than, the duty imposed by the 
Convention. This position is a departure from the usual situation in which the jurisprudence of the UK 
and the ECtHR aligns. As to the UKSC’s concern in Kaiyam , noted above, the ECtHRs approach does 
not entail an obligation under the Convention to secure the applicant’s immediate release , as other 
remedies exist which can remedy the lack of opportunity for rehabilitation [42-4 3]. 
Accordingly, the UKSC  should no w adopt the same  approach to the interpretation of article 5(1)(a) as 
the ECtHR  in James , and cease to treat the obligation to provide opportunities for rehabilitation  as an 
ancillary obligation i mplic it in article 5 as a whole.  It is noted , however,  that a high threshold has to be 
surmounted in order to establis h a violation of the obligation [44-45]. 
Application to extended sentences  
Whereas the previous cases on the duty to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation concerned life or 
IPP sentences, t he present c ase concerns extended sentences , which may be imposed pursuant to section 
210A of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 . An extended sentence  comprises a custodial term 
and an extension period  for which the offender is to be on licence beyond the licence period under  the 
custodial term . A court may impose a n extended sentence if  it considers the licence period under the 
custodial term to be  insufficient for the protection of the public. When the prisoner subject to the 
extended sentence is released on licence, the licence remains in force until the end of the extension 
period. The licence  may be revoked  if the  offender  commit s a further offence [46-55]. 
The duty to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation  established in James should apply  equally to 
prisoners detained during the extension period of  an extended sentence , having regard to the indefinite 
(albeit not unlimited) duration of detention during the extension period, its purpose  of protecting the 
public from serious harm , and the possibility of change in response to opportunities for rehabilitation . 
The rationale in  James  that rehabilitation opportunities had to be available to IPP prisoners where they 
were detained solely becaus e of the risk they pose to the public, applies to prisoners detained during the 
extension period of an extended sentence [59-63]. 
Application to the present case  
In light of th e various opportunities for rehabilitation provided to the appellant in the present case , there 
can be no doubt that he was provided with a real opportunity for rehabilitation  during his custodial  
sentence and his extended sentence . The appellant was not left in limbo without sentencing planning 
and without any attempt to provide him with an opportunity to rehabilitate himself. On the contrary, 
there were courses provided and completed, regular planning meetings, efforts made to find appropriate 
rehabilitative work, and transfers to less restrictive conditions. The problem which re sulted in the 
appellant’s serving the whole of his sentence was not the failure of the prison authorities to provide 
appropriate courses, but his own misconduct. There is no question of his detention during the extension 
period, or at any other point durin g his sentence, having been arbitrary  [65-85].

The Appeal is allowed. Lor d Neuberger gives the lead judg ment with which  Lord Clarke, Lord Sumption 
and Lord Hodge  agree. Lord Sumption gives a concurring judgment. Lord Mance dissents  on the facts.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Appellants submitted that the negotiation period expenses fell within the expression “expense 
incurred” by the owners within Rule F and those expenses were incurred “in place of another expense” 
(i.e. the $4.15m saved as a result of the negotiations with the pirates). Further, the negotiation period 
expenses were less tha n the “general average expense avoided” and it thereby followed  that they were 
properly allowable under R ule F [14].  
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The Court found that the Judge and Court of Appeal incorrectly assumed that the owners had to 
establish that it would have been reasonable to accept the pirates’ initial demand in order to justify the 
contention that the negotiation period expenses were allowable under Rule F. Such an assumption would 
lead to very odd results . It would mean that, if a ship -owner incurs an expense to avoid paying a 
reasonable sum, he can in principle recover under Rule F, whereas if he incurs expense to avoid paying 
an unreasonable sum ( i.e. a larger sum), he cannot recover  [18]. Further, the reference in Rule F to 
“another expense which would have been allowable as general average” does not mean an expense whose 
quantum is such that it would have qualified as a claim under Rule A of the Rules (which refers to 
“extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure” ) [19]. Therefore, subject to the Respondents’ other arguments, 
the negotiation period expenses fell under Rule F as they were incurred to avoid paying $6m [20]. 
 
The Respondents submitted that th e negotiation period expenses did  not fall within Rule F because the 
payment of reduced ransom of $1.85m was not an “alternative course of action” to the payment of the 
ransom originally demanded but was merely a variant [22].  The Court found that the incurring of the 
negotiation period e xpenses did represent an alternative course of action from the payment of the 
$4.15 m (the amount by which the ransom was reduced). The former involved incurring vessel operating 
expenses and the latter involved paying a ransom [26]. To imply some qualifica tion such as the 
requirement that the negotiation period expenses must be incurred so as to achieve an “alternative course 
of action” was very dangerous  [29]. The Rules are an international arrangement and should be 
interpreted in the same way as an intern ational convention or treaty , unconstrained by technical rules of 
English law or by English legal precedent , on broad ly accepted general principles  [29].  
 
The Respondents raised four further  points. Firstly, they contended  that the Appellants could not 
recover under Rule F as they had never made a conscious and intentional choice between paying the 
$6m ransom i nitially demanded  or negotiating [33]. The Court held that the question of whether one 
expense has been incurred “i n the place of another expense” must be assessed objectively [34]. Secondly, 
the Respondents contended that the negotiation period expenses were not “extra” expenses within the 
meaning  of Rule F. The Court found that there was no reason for restrictively interpreting the word  
“extra”  so as to require  an expense to be of a nature which would not normally have been incurred in 
response to the peril threatening the adventure [35]. Thirdly, the Respondents contended that the 
negotiation period expenses may have  been incurred even if the owners had agreed to the pirates’ initial 
demand. However, the Judge considered that it was more likely than not that the vessel would have been 
released promptly if the $6m demand had been accepted . It was not appropriate for th e Supreme Court 
to interfere with this finding of the Judge [36].  
 
Finally, the Respondents contended that because Rule C of the Rules excludes “indirect loss” from 
general average expenditure and/or because Rule IX includes crew wages and maintenance whe re it 
applies, the claim in the present case must fail. The Court held that even though negotiation period 
expenses fall within Rule C it does not follow that they fall outside Rule F. By definition, sums 
recoverable under Rule F are not themselves allowab le in general average, but are alternatives to sums 
which would be allowable [37]. Further, in terms of Rule IX, the Court did not agree that because vessel -
operating expenses were specifically allowed in one type of case that it should be presumed that th ey are 
excluded from every other type of case [38].  
 
Both the lead judgment by Lord Neuberger [25] and the concurring judgment by Lord Sumption [42] 
observed that a variety of practices have been developed by practitioners in relation to the Rules but that 
the law cannot be determined by reference  to these practices.  In his dissenting judgment [45-68], Lord 
Mance concluded that whilst the Appellants had established that Rule F is in principle capable of 
applying to negotiation period expenses , they had not established on the only factual basis on which 
their case had been put that they had a claim under Rule F [68].

It was common ground that the  parties’  contract for betting contain ed an implied term that neither of 
them will cheat. [35] It would be unwise to attempt a definition of cheating. Its essentials  normally 
involve a deliberate act designed to gain an advantage in the play which is objectively improper given 
the parameters a nd rules of the game in question. What amounts to cheating is a jury question. 
Dishonesty  is not a concept that  would bring clarity or certainty to a jury’s assessment of whether 
certain behaviour is or is not cheating. [47-48] 
 
It is an essential element of Punto Banco that it is a game of  pure chance. Mr Ivey staged a carefully 
planned and executed sting. If he had secretly gained access to the shoe of cards and persona lly re -
arranged them that would  be considered  cheating. He accomplished the same result s by directing the 
actions of the croupier and tricking her into thinking that what she did was irrelevant. Mr Ivey’s 
actions were positive steps to fix the deck and therefore  constituted cheating. [50] 
 
Dishonesty is included in the definition of some but  not all acquisitive criminal offences. [52] R v 
Ghosh  [1982] EWCA Crim 2 introduced a two -stage test for dishonesty  for a jury to apply, with a 
subjective second leg . Firstly,  the jury  must ask whether in its judgment the conduct complained of was 
dishone st by the lay objective standards of ordinary reasonable and honest people. If the answer is no, 
that disposes of the case in favour of the defendant. But if the answer is yes, it must ask, secondly, 
whether the defendant must have realised that ordinary h onest people would so regard his behaviour  
as dishonest , and he is to be convicted only if the answer to that second question is yes.  However, the 
second leg of the rule adopted in Ghosh  has serious problems . The principal objection is that the less a 
defendant’s standards conform  to society’s expectations, the less likely they are  to be held criminally 
responsible for their behaviour. The law should not excuse those who make a mistake about 
contemporary standards of honesty , a purpose of the criminal law  is to set acceptable standards of 
behaviour . [54, 57 -59] 
 
In civil actions the law has settled on an objective test of dishonesty. There can be no logical or 
principled basis for the meaning of dishonesty to differ according to whether it arises in a civil action 
or a criminal prosecution. [62-63] The second leg of the test propounded in Ghosh does not correctly 
represent the law and directions based upon it ought no longer to be given. The test of dishonesty is 
that used in  civil actions . The fact-finding t ribunal must ascertain  (subjectively) the actual state of the 
individual’s  knowledge or belief as to the facts  and then determine whether his conduct was honest or 
dishonest by the (objective) standards of ordinary decent people. There is no requirement th at the 
defendant must appreciate that what he has done is, by those standards , dishonest. [74] 
 
If cheating at gambling required an additional legal element of dishonesty, it would be satisfied in this 
case. [75]

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
An approved strategic development plan is of central importance to planning decisions under the 1997 
Act [25]. Supplementary guidance deals with the provision of further infor mation  in respect of proposals 
set out in the plan [24]. 
 
Planning obligations in terms of s75 of the 1997 Act do not necessarily need to relate to a particular 
permitted development on the burdened land. A planning obligation may  be entered into in 
circumstances which are not connected with any planning application [38]. For instance, a planning 
authority may contract for the payment of financial contributions towards certain infrastructure  
necessitated by the cumulative effect of  various developments, so long as the land which is subject to 
the obligation contributes to that cumulative effect [41].  
 
However, it is not lawful to restrict the comme ncement of development  by planning obligation until the 
developer undertakes to make a financial contribution towards infrastructure which is unconnected with 
the development of the site  [42-43]. If such a planning obligation were lawful, an authority could use an 
application  to extract benefits which are unrelated to the proposed development [44].  Moreover, it is 
not lawful to require contributions towards such infrastructure in a planning obligation which does not 
restrict the development of the site by means of a negative s uspensive condition , as such a planning 
obligation would neither restrict nor regulate the development of the site in terms of s75 [43].  
 
In determining a planning application, the authority must take into consideration material provisions of 
the developme nt plan  and other material considerations . For a planning obliga tion to be material  it must 
have some connection with the proposed development which is not trivial [47-48]. If a planning 
obligation, which is otherwise irrelevant to the application, is soug ht as a policy in the development plan, 
the policy seeking to impose such an obligation is an irrelevant considerat ion for determination of the 
planning application  [51]. 
 
In the instant case, t he scheme established in the supplementary guidance involved  the pooling of 
payments which were  not tied to a particular development [56].  The opt -out did  not make the scheme 
voluntary in any real sense [57]. The 1997 Act does not allow for such a scheme . The supplementary 
guidance and the planning obligations which it promotes are unlawful for two reasons [60].  
 
Firstly, the use of the developer’s contribution to the pooled Fund on infrastructure with which its 
development has no more than a trivial connection means that the planning obligation is not imposed 
for a purpose related to the development and use of the burdened site as required by s75 , [61] nor did 
the planning obligation restrict or regulate the development within the meaning of s75 [62]. 
 
Secondly, the planning obligation entered into by  the Respondent was an irreleva nt consideration in 
terms of a planning application because there was only a trivial connection between the development 
and the infrastructure intervention(s) which the propo sed contribution would  fund. An authority is not 
empowered to requi re a developer to enter into an obligation which would be irrelevant to an application 
for permission as a precondition of the grant of that permission [63]. 
 
The scheme was not unlawful because it did not comply with the Circular. The Circular was simply a 
material consideration which was required to be taken into account but  not necessarily followed [53-54; 
60].

The Su preme Court unanimously allows the appeal , finding that EU law requires police officers to be 
able to bring claims in the Employment Tribunal in respect of dismissals following proceedings before 
a police misconduct panel . Such claims cannot be barred by j udicial immunity.  Lord Reed , with whom 
the other Justices agree,  gives the lead judgment. Lord Hug hes gives a concurring judgment . 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Directly effective EU rights : where directly effective EU rights are in issue, EU law must be both  the 
starting point and the finishing point of the analysis , since EU law take s priority over domestic law . EU 
Council Directive 2000/78/EC (“the directive”) confers  on all persons, including police office rs, a 
directly effective right to be treated in acc ordance with the principle of equal treatment in relation to 
employment and working conditions, including dismissals. The UK is obliged to ensure that appropriate 
judicial and/or administ rative procedures are available , and that effective, proportionate an d dissuasive 
sanctions are applied. The procedures under national law must comply with the general principles of 
effectiveness and equivalence, and with the right to an effective remedy  under article 47 of  the Charter 
of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  [27-28].  
 
Principles of equivalence and effectiveness :  
• The principle of equivalence requires  that police officers must have the right to bring claims of 
treatment contrary to the directive before Employment Tribunals. This is  because  comparable  
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 discrimination claims can be brought before t hose tribunals in domestic law. On that basis, 
leaving police officers with a claim only to the Police Appeals Tribunal would not  comply with 
the principle of equivalence  [29].  
• Allowing police officers  to bring  claims to Employment Tribunals  also fulfils  the principle of 
effectiveness, because Employment Tribunals  have the power to award a range of remedies, 
including compensation. The remedies available before the  Police Appeal Tribunal are more 
limited  than those  available  before the Employment Tribunals  [29]. 
• The UK is not entitled to deny police officers an effective and equivalent remedy. The right not 
to be discriminated against is a fundamental right in EU law.  The creation of a statutory process , 
which entrusts disciplinary functions to persons who might benefit from  judicial immunity , 
cannot bar complaints to an Employment T ribunal  by police off icers who claim that they have 
been treated contrary to the directive. National rules in relation to jud icial immunity can be 
applied in accordance with EU law only in so far as they are consistent with EU law [30]. 
 
Interpretation of the  legislation:   
• The Equality Act 2010 plainly confers on police constables the rig ht to bring proceedings before 
Employment  Tribunals in order to challenge discrimination by chief officers and responsible 
officers . This is plain from section 42(1), which provides that a police constable is deemed to be 
the employee of the chief officer or of the responsible authority in relati on to acts done by those 
persons in relation to the constable . It was presumably envisaged by  Parliament that the exercise 
of disciplinary functions in relation to police officers would fall under those provisions  [31]. 
• Read literally, however, the Act doe s not cover the exercise of d isciplinary functions  in relation  
to police officers who have completed their period of probation , other than senior officers, when  
those disciplinary functions are entrusted to a misconduct panel . This is because  the exercise of 
disciplinary  functions by a panel is not an act done by either the chief officer or the responsible 
authority  within the meaning of section 42(1) . This readin g fails to fully implement the d irective 
[32]. 
• The problem can be resolved by interpreting sect ion 42(1) of the 2010 Act as applying to the 
exercise of disciplinary functions by misconduct panels in relation to police constables, by 
reading  words in to section 42(1)(a) to that effect. Such an interpretation  runs with the grain of 
the legislation and is warranted under the EU principle  of conforming  interpretation . This does 
not mean the cour t is amending the legislation and is merely a way of interpreting the legislation 
to conform with EU law in a case such as the present [33-34]. 
 
Conclusion : The appeal is allowed. The reasoning of the Court of Appeal in  the case of  Heath v 
Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis  [2004] EWCA Civ 943 (which held that EU law  could  not displace 
the common law rule of judicial immunity), was unsound. The present  case should be remitted to the 
Employment Tribunal  [35]. 
 
Lord Hughes gives a judgment , agreeing with the judgment of Lord Reed , and adding  that the principle 
of judici al immunity generally serves a legitimate, proportionate and useful role. He considers that the  
scope for parallel or collateral proceedings in both the Employment T ribunals and the Police Appeals 
Tribunal , which exists under the present legislation , might be considered in any future review of the 
legislation [37-39].

The Supreme Court  allows the appeal  by a majority of three to two . Lord Clarke  gives the lead judgment , 
and. Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge  concurring judgments . Lord Neuberger  and Lord Mance  dissent.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT   
 
The interpretation of the letters of credit  
 
The court could  make the TPDO  only if CA’s debt was owed  to SOMO  as the sole creditor , 
notwithstanding CA’s obligation to make payment to an account in the name of CBI.  [3, 9]. SOMO was 
the sole beneficiary of the letters of credit  because: (i)  the language of the letters expressly  identifies  
SOMO as “the beneficiary” [18-19, 62-63, 76] and (ii) that conclusion fits with the use of the term 
“beneficiary” in articles 2 and 18 of the UCP , which must be considered in interpreting the letters  and 
to which the credit was subject  [19-20, 62, 76].  In the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, CA’s 
primary obligation to make payment was owed to SOMO alone . CA’s separate obligation , owed jointly 
to SOMO and  CBI under each letter , was collateral  to that primary obligation  [23, 65, 79].  
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Lord Sumption adds that , if the parties  had intended CBI to be the debtor , the obvious solution would 
have been a  transfer  or assignment  of credit to CBI , as permitted by  article 38 of the UCP  [64]. Lord 
Sumption  and Lord Hodge each reason that nothing in the terms of the letters shows any such transfer , 
and the terms expressly exclude that possibility [64, 77].  
 
The location of the debt  
 
Debts  have a location for legal purposes.  If CA’s debts were situate d outside England and Wales, the 
court would be unable to make a TPDO in respect of them unless, under the law of the location , payment 
in compliance with the  TPDO would discharge CA from those  debts  to the extent  of CA’s payment  
[29]. The debt s were  located in England , because  that was where they were recoverable [30-31]. The 
Court of Appeal had been bound by its own reasoning in Power Curber v National Bank of Kuwait SAK 
[1981] 1 WLR 1233 , so had instead  concluded  that the debts were located where they were payable.  The 
reasoning in that case was not extensive , has not become  well-established, and was incorrect [32-41].  
 
The effect of CA’s obligations to CBI  
 
There is no independent rule that  a TPDO can be made only in respect of property with which the 
judgment debtor can “honestly deal ”. The rule is only that a TPDO  cannot be made  in respect of 
property which does not belong  to the judgment debtor . Unpaid debts under the letters of credit were 
not CBI’s  property [45-46]. Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge  each add that the TPDO modified CA’s  
primary obligation, which was owed to SOMO and which was  to pay money into CBI’s account , so that 
payment in compliance with the TPDO discharge d CA from its debt to SOMO. CA’s  collateral 
obligation  to CBI  was to discharge that primary obligation by a particular payment method . Once the 
primary obligation was discharged , that  collateral obligation falls away . Compliance with the TPDO 
would consequently dischar ge CA from its liabilities to the extent of its payment. As a result, CA’s 
obligations to CBI could not prevent the court from making the TPDO  [70-71, 79]. 
 
The receivership order  
 
A receivership order is appropriate because: (i) it was predictable, in all  the circumstances, tha t SOMO 
would be sued in England, under English law, for the purpose of enforcing the arbitral awar d if SOMO 
declined to honour that  award; (ii) domestic and international policy favours the efficient recognition 
and enforcement of ar bitration awards; (iii) it would be inconsistent to treat the arbitration award as a 
judgment of the English courts for enforcement purposes, whilst limiting the  available  enforcement 
methods  on the basis of an insufficient connection to this jurisdiction  [54-55]. CBI’s account  in New 
York  is merely the condui t via which monies paid from CA pass onwards into the Iraqi government 
budget. There is no evidence that CA would be prejudiced by the receivership order.  [56-58].  
 
Dissenting judgments  
 
Lord Mance and Lord Neuberger give dissenting judgments . They each conclude that the letters of credit 
created debts  which were owed to CBI alone [94-101, 126-138]. Lord Mance  further  considers that the 
TPDO would contravene the principle that a TPDO cannot place a judgment creditor (Taurus) in a 
better position than the judgment debtor (SOMO) in relation to the third party (CA) [90-91, 115] . There 
is no basis, in his opinion, for regarding CA’s obligations to pay CBI as collateral to , or conditional on,  
some primary obligation to pay the proceeds to SOMO [112-113, 117].  
 
Lord Neuberger  reason s further that CA’s compliance with the TPDO could not discharge any 
“separate” obligation owed to CBI, effectively requiring CA to pay the sums due under the credits twice: 
once pursuant to the TPDO, and once pursuant to its obligations to CBI.  The TPDO was inappr opriate 
for that reason [141]  and/or because it would grant Taurus rights to the sums which prevailed over those  
of CBI, in circumstances where Taurus knew  of CBI’s prior rights [143] .

The Supreme Court allows the appeal and dismisses the application by the Respondent , Mr Loughlin,  
for judicial review. Lord Kerr gives the judgment with which all other members of the panel agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMEN T 
 
Section 74 of the 2005 Act requires that, before deciding to refer a sentence passed on an assisting 
offender back to the original sentencing court a prosecutor must  be satisfied that the assisting offender 
had knowingly failed to comply with the terms of the agreement  made with the prosecuting authorities  
and that a reference was in the interests of justice [11-12]. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
The Court rejected the Respon dent’s argument that the prosecutor was required to carefully examine 
every conceivable aspect of the Stewart s’ accounts. This would  have placed an impossible logistical 
burden on the prosecutor [15-16]. 
 
The prosecutor considered that it would not be in the interests of justice to refer the decision back to 
the sentencing court. She identified five factors relev ant to her decision: (i) the nature and extent of 
assistance provided ; (ii) the time which had elapsed since the original sentence had been passed ; (iii) 
whether the imposition of a revised sentence might be considered oppressive ; (iv) the potential damage  
to public confidence in the justice system if a referral was not made ; and (v) the prospects of a 
successful application to the review ing court. Having analysed t hese factors in relation to the Stewarts, 
the prosecutor concluded that the case should not b e referred  [17-19]. 
 
The Divisional Court  had  considered the key question to be whether circumstances had changed  since 
the original sentence had been passed , suggesting that  (i) the prosecutor must first consider  whether 
there ha d been a change of circum stances ; and (ii) if such a change had occurred , unless there were 
countervailing circumstances , she was bound to conclude that it was in the interests of justice that the 
case be referred  [21-22]. 
 
The Court rejected this conclusion.  To require the prosec utor to refer a sentence back where there had 
been a change of circumstance would entail a reference in any instance of deviation by the assisting 
offender f rom the agreement .  The requirement that the referral be in the interests of justice would 
then hav e no meaningful content . Consideration of the interests of justice invol ves an open -ended 
deliberation - section 74(4) does not impose any constraints on how the prosecutor should approach 
the question  [29-31].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.  Lord Sumption gives the judgment, with which 
Lord Neuberger, Lady Hale, Lord Clarke and Lord Wilson  agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The 1978 Act renders a foreign state  immune  from the jurisdiction  of a UK court  in a claim  based on 
the foreign state’s employment of the claimant , where the claimant  either : (i) at the tim e of the contract, 
was neither a UK natio nal nor UK resident ; or (ii) works for the foreign state’s diplomatic mission . 
Section 4(2) (b) confers immunity in the first category; section 16(1)(a)  confers immunity  in the second  
[1, 11] . Article 6 of the ECHR confers  a right of access to a court to determine disputes , although that 
right is not absolute  [14]. The Claimants argued that the relevant provisions of the 1978 Act were 
incompatible with EU law and with Article 6 of the ECHR, because they prevented access to a court in 
circumstances where this result was not required by international law. The Secretary  of State argued  (i) 
that a court’s recognition of state immunity can never amount to an infringement of article 6 , because it 
only reflects the court’s lack of jurisdiction over a foreign state , but (ii) that in any event the relevant 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  provisions of the Act were consistent with international law or at least with a tenable view of international 
law. [29-30, 34-35]. 
The test was whether the relevant provisions of the Act were consistent with international law, not 
whether there was a tenable view to that effect. These provisions were not consistent with international 
law. A court may identify a rule of customary international law only if enough states follow a consistent 
practice , on the footing that it is a legal obligation [31]. The Secretary of State argued that although states 
now recognise a more restrictive doctrine of state immunity, the immunity is still absolute unless there 
is sufficient international consensus to show that Libya and Sudan fall into any established exception to 
that absolute immunity [33]. This Court rejects those arguments, which mischaracterise the historical 
development of the restrictive doctrine of immunity.  Specifically : (i) while there is a long-standing 
consensus of states in favour of immunity there has probably never been sufficient international 
consensus for an absolute rule of state immunity in cust omary international law; (ii) the only consensus 
that there has ever been about the scope of state immunity is the relatively recent consensus in favour 
of the restrictive doctrine; (iii) that restrictive doctrine emerged after a re-examination of the true basis 
of the doctrine, rather than by creating exceptions to any general rule of absolute immunity [40-52]. 
In customary international law, a foreign state is immune where  a claim is based on  sovereign  acts. 
Whether a foreign state’s  employment  of a claimant  constitutes  a sovereign act  depends on the nature 
of that employer -employee relationship. That will, in turn, depend primarily on the functions which the 
employee is employed to perform. The employment of purely domestic staff in  a diplomati c mission  is 
a private act , rather than an inherently sovereign act. That approach is supported by  the reasoning in 
case law  from the United States, France, and the European Court of Human Rights  [53-56]. 
Under s ection 4(2)(b)  of the Act , whether a foreign state is immune depends entirely  on the nationality 
and residence of the claimant  at the date of the employment contr act. That  section draws no distinction 
between acts of a private nature and acts of a sovereign nature.  That approach to state immu nity is 
followed by some states but lacks a ny basis in customary international law  [64-66]. A person’s nationality 
and residence at the date of the employment contract are not proper grou nds for denying a person access 
to the courts in respect of their employment in this country [67]. 
Section 16(1)(a) extends state immunity to the employment of all members  of a diplomatic mission . The 
Court rejects  the Secretary of State’s argument  that a state is entitled  in international law  to absolute 
immunity in respect of the employment of embassy staff . Although article 7 of the Vienna Convention 
on Diplomatic Relations 1961 indicates  that a court  may not order a foreign state to employ a specific 
person in its embassy , this issue does not arise where the claimant only seeks damages  (rather than  
reinstatement  in his or her previous position ) [68-69]. Nor is there a ny corresponding rule of customary 
international law to extend absolute  state immunity to the employment of embassy staff  [70-72]. 
As a matter of customary international law,  therefore,  neither Sudan nor Libya are entitle d to immunity 
in respect of these claims.  Sections 4(2)(b) and 16(1)(a) of the 1978 Act , which confer immunity in 
English law,  are consequently incompat ible with article 6 of the ECHR  [74-75]. In light of that, the  
Secretary of State  accepted that those sections were also incompatible with article 47 of the EU Charter 
[77]. The Court also accept s Ms Janah’s argument  that section 16(1) (a) of the 1978 Act discriminated 
unjustifiably on the grounds of nationality, but in the circumstances that add s nothing  [76]. EU law 
prevails over English law in the event of a conflict , so those sections of the 1978 Act cannot bar the 
claims which are based on  EU law  [77]. Those  EU law  claims are  remitted to the Employment  Tribunal,  
to be determined at trial . The other claims remain barred by the 1978 Act, notwithstanding that the 
Court of Appeal properly made a declaration of incompatibility with the E CHR in respect of them [78].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal  and dismisses the cross -appeal . Lord Sumption 
gives the lead judgment, with which Lord Neuberger agrees. Lord Wilson gives a separate  judgment in 
which  he concurs  with that of Lord Sumption , save in respect of one point. Lady Hale and Lord 
Clarke agree with the judgment of Lord Wilson.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Diplomatic immunity  is not an immunity from liability.  It is immunity from the jurisdiction of the 
courts of the s tate which hosts the diplomat  (the “ receiving  state”)  [7-9].  
 
The claim form was  served validly, without violating  the protections  conferred on diplomats and their 
residences respectively by articles 29 and 30 of the Convention : the service  of a claim for m by p ost 
does not involve any trespass against the diplomat’s person or residence; it merely conveys information  
[13-16]. 
 
The Convention draws a fundamental distinction between the acts of a diplomat  which are performed  
in the exercise of an “official fu nction” and those which are not . The former are immune because they The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 are committed on behalf of a state. The immunity of the latter  is justified  on the pragmatic basis that it 
facilitate s diplomatic relations . Article 31(1) confers diplomatic immunity on bo th types of  acts, subject 
to specified exceptions . Once  a diplomat’s posting has come to an end , his or her immunity after 
leaving the receiving  state is ordinarily limited to  a “residual immunity”  under article 39(2) . That 
residual immunity applies only  to acts  performed the exercise  of “official functions ” [17-18]. Acts 
performed in the exercise of a diplomat’s official functions are limited to  acts which are part of the 
diplomatic functions of the diplomatic mission, performed on behalf of  the state which that  diplomat  
represents  [20].  
 
Mr and Mrs Al -Malki left the United Kingdom  at the end of Mr Al -Malki’s posting , so the only 
potentially relevant immunity is the “ residual immunity”  in respect of official acts.  The employment  of 
Ms Reyes to carry out do mestic tasks in the residence of Mr and Mrs Al -Malki was not an act in the 
exercise of the diplomatic functions of the mission. Nor was it done on behalf of Saudi Arabia , even 
though it assisted  Mr Al -Malki  in the performance of his official functions . It was not there the 
exercise of an official function . Consequently , neither Mr Al -Malki nor Mrs Al -Malki may rely on that 
residual immunity  [48].  
 
The appeal is therefore  allowed.  Unless within 21 days the parties in writing justify an alternative, the 
case will be remitted to the Employment Tri bunal to be determined at trial  [54-55]. 
 
Lord Sumption,  with whom Lord Neuberger agrees , expresses the view  (obiter) that Mr Al -Malki 
would have been  entitled to immunity  under article 31(1)  if he had still be en in post. Ms Reyes sought 
to rely on an exception  to article 31(1) , set out in article 31(1)(c). That exception applies  in civil claims 
“relating to any professional or commercial activity exercised by the diplomatic agent in the receiving 
State outside his off icial functions.” Lord Sumption  would have concluded  that the acts alleged do not  
constitute  the “exercise” of a “prof essional or commercial activity ” [51]. Lord Sumption  reasons  that: 
(i) the wording of the exception envisages a diplomat  who also conducts  a business, practise s a 
profession , or similar  [21(1)-(3)]; (ii) the drafting history of the Convention confirms that this was the 
drafters’  intention [21(4), 34-38]; (iii) the reasoning in case law  from the United States  support s that 
interpretation  [22-25]; (iv) the reasons for the exception are  obvious : nothing in the concept of 
diplomatic immunity requires it to  protect a diplomat’s private  business activities , in competition with 
others,  from business -related claims [21(5)] ; (v) a wide interpretation of the  exception risks exposing 
diplomats to liability in respect of everyday transactions, undermining  the carefully -constructed scheme 
of immunities  under the Convention  [21(6) ]; (vi) nothing in the Convention nor in wider international 
law justifies  interpretation of  the Convention with reference to the International Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons  (Palermo, 2000)  (“the Palermo Protocol” ) and nothing in 
the Palermo Protocol  would require a different  interpretation  of article 31(1)(c)  [41-47]. 
 
Lord Wilson, with whom Lady Hale and Lord Clarke agree , welcomes  the lack of any binding decision 
as to whether Mr Al -Malki would have been immune,  had he remained  in his post . In his view the 
answer is not obvious [57]. This is  becau se: (i) the exploitation of migrant domestic workers by 
diplomats  is a significant problem  [59]; (ii) there is a global  determinat ion to combat human trafficking  
[60]; (iii) the employment of trafficked persons may form part of the wider commercial activit y of 
“trafficking”  [61-62]; (iv) the absence of state immunity in similar cases  is difficult to reconcile with 
recognition of  diplo matic immunity  in this case  [63]-[64]; (v) it is not clear how recognition  of Mr Al -
Malki’s immunity would further the stated  purpose of the Convention  [66]. Lord Wilson disagree s 
with Lord Sumption’s opinion that it was inappropriate to construe article 31(1)(c) in the light of the 
more recent international condemnation  of human trafficking  [67]. He invite s the International La w 
Commission to consider amendment of  the Convention [68].

The Supreme Court  allows the appeal  by a majority of 4 -1, finding the local authority vicariously liable 
for the abuse committed by the foster parents, but rejecting the argument that the local authority were 
liable on the basis of  a non -delegable duty . Lord Reed gives the lead judgment, with which Lady Hale, 
Lord Kerr and Lord Clarke agree.  Lord Hughes gives a dissenting judgment.    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgment  
 
Non -delegable duty of care  
 
A local authority are not under a non -delegable duty  to ensure that reasonable care is taken for the safety 
of children in care while they are in the care and control of foster parents . Such a proposition is too 
broad, and fixes local authorities with too demanding a responsibility [49]. The following reasons are 
given : 
 
• The Child Care Act 1980  (“the 1980 Act”)  permits a local  authority to arrange for children in 
care to spend time staying with their parents or grandparents, or other relatives or friends. 
Imposing a strict liability on local authorities for the lack of care of those relatives or friends 
would risk creating a co nflict between the local authority’s duty, under section 18(1) of the 1980 
Act, to give first consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child, 
and their interests in avoiding exposure to such liability . It would also risk creati ng a form of 
state insurance in situations where the local authority place the child with the child’s  own parents 
[45]. 
 
• The 1980  Act require d the local authority to “discharge” the duty to provide accommodation 
and maintenance for a child , including by placing the child with foster parents. This implies  that, 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 although  the local authority ha ve numerous duties towards the child, the ir duty is not to provide 
the child  with day to day care , but rather to arrange for, and monitor, the performan ce of that 
function by the foster parents [46-47]. 
 
• The Secretary of State make s regulations under section 22 of the 1980 Act imposing duties on 
local authorities in relation to  the boarding out of children . The implication of section 22 is that 
the local authority’s continuing responsibility for the child is discharged by boarding -out the 
child  in accordance with those  regulations , including by prior approval of the household, and 
subsequent inspection, supervision and removal. The statutory regime d oes not impose any 
responsibility for the day to day care of the child  [48].   
 
Vicarious liability  
 
Applying the principles  set out  in Cox v Ministry of Justice  [2016] UKSC 10  on the imposition of vicarious 
liability , the local authority  are vicariously liable  for the acts of the foster parents  in the present case  for 
the following reasons : 
 
• Integration and business activity : The local authority carried out the recruitment, selection and 
training of foster parents, paid their expenses, and su pervised the foster ing. In those 
circumstances, t he foster parents were not carrying on an independent business of their own , 
and it is impossible to draw a sharp distinction between the activity of the local authority and 
that of the foster parents. T hus the abuse committed  by the foster parents  against the claimant 
was committed by the foster parents in the course of an activity carried on for the benefit of the 
local authority [59-60]. 
 
• Creation of risk:  The placement of children with foster parents crea tes a relationship of authority 
and trust between the foster parents and children  in circumstances where close control cannot 
be exercise d by the local authority. This renders the children particularly vulnerable to abuse 
[61]. 
 
• Control : The local authority exercise d a significant degree of control over the foster parents: it 
exercise d powers of approval, inspection, supervision and removal [62]. Micro -management, or 
a high degree of control, are not necessary  for the imposition of vicarious liability  [65]. 
 
• Ability to pay damages : Most foster parents have insufficient means to meet a substantial award 
of damages, whilst local authorities can more easily compensate the victims of abuse [63]. 
 
• There was no evidence to suggest that i mposing vicarious  liability would  discourage local 
authorities from placing children in care with foster parents , and encourage them instead to 
place them in residential home s, at much greater cost . [68].  
 
In response to the concerns raised by Lord Hughes: (1) The approach adopted would not have resulted 
in the imposition of vicarious liability if the appellant had been placed with her own parents. (2) This 
decision is concerned only with the legislation and  practice that was in force at the relevant time, not 
with the current regime . (3) The courts’ care not to impose unduly exacting standards in the context of 
family life applies equally to life in foster families [71-73]. 
 
Lord Hughes gives a dissenting ju dgment on the vicarious liability issue . He considers that t he majority’s  
approach would  extend vicarious liability to  family and friend  placements under the current  statutory 
regime , and consequently inhibit local authorities’  practice of  making such placements. Finally, he 
considers that it may result in undesirable litigation of family activity in the courts [87-90].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The central issue in this appeal is whether para 3.2.2.2  (and para 3b.5.1) of the Technical Requirements  was 
infringed  [27, 33]. The second limb of para 3.2.2.2 reads: “The design of the foundations shall ensure a 
lifetime of twenty  years in every aspect without planned replacement.”  Taking in to account other aspects of 
the Technical Requirements , this  can be read in two ways: e ither as a warranty that the foundations  will 
actually have a lifetime  for twenty years , or as an undertaking to provide a design that  can objectively be 
expected to have  a lifetime of twenty years.  Although there is some force in the latter argument , especially 
in the contract’s  (exclusive) remedies regime  [27-32], the question does not warrant an answer in this appeal. 
The foundations  neither  had a lifetime of  twenty years, nor was their design fit to  ensure one  [24-32]. 
Therefore, the effect of  para 3.2.2.2 according to  its terms would be to render  MTH liable.  
 
The reference to J101,  the international design standard, which included the flawed value attributed to δ, 
does not require a different construction  which  would  deviate  from the natural language  of para 3.2.2.2 . 
Both J101 and para 3.2.2.2. are part of the same contract.  The reconciliation of various  terms  in a contract , 
and the determination of their combined effect  must be decided by refe rence to ordinary principles of 
contractual interpretation [37, 48]. While each case must turn on its own facts, the courts are generally 
inclined to give full effect to the requirement that the item as produced complies with the prescribed criteria, 
even if the customer or employer has specified or approved the design. Thus , generally speaking,  the 
contractor is expected to take the risk if he agreed to work to a design which would render the item incapable 
of meeting the criteria to which he has agreed [38-44]. The Technical Requirements expressly prescribe only 
a minimum s tandard . It was the contractor, i.e. MTH’s , responsibility to identify areas where the works 
needed to be designed in a more rigorous way  (para 3.1.(1)) . Further, i t was contemplate d that MTH might 
go beyond certain standards , including J101  (para 3.1.2) [45-47]. 
 
Finally, para 3.2.2.2 of the Technical Requirements is not too weak a basis on which to rest a contention 
that MTH  had a liability to warrant that the foundations would survive for twenty  years or would be designed 
so as to achieve twenty  years of lifetime.  Applying the ordinary principles of interpretation, in a complex 
contract, this interpretation gives way to the n atural meaning of para  3.2.2.2  and is not improbable or 
unbusinesslike [48-51].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
So-called grey market goods are caught by the criminal offence in s.92(1), and the appellants’ 
contended construction of that section must be rejected. The plain reading of “ such a sign” in 
(1)(b) is that it refers back to the sign mentioned in (1)(a) i.e. a sign which is “identical to, or likely 
to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark”. 1(b) therefore covers the unauthorised sale of any The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 goods bearing a trademark (regardle ss of whether the trademark was applied to the goods in their 
manufacture with consent or not). But this reference back to (1)(a) does not also incorporate  into 
the meaning of “such a sign”  the commission of an offence under (1)(a) , i.e. the requirement th at 
the sign h as been applied without the consent of the proprietor. Such a reading of (1)(b) is strained 
and unnatural and requires one to read “such sign” as “such a sign, so applied”. The offences set 
out in (a), (b) and (c) are not cumulative, but separ ate, and the requirement in the opening lines of 
s.92(1) that the use made of the sign is “without the consent of the proprietor” applies to each type 
of use specified – whether it is the application of a trademark to goods, the sale of goods bearing a 
trademark, or the possession for sale of goods bearing a trademark. [8-12] The predecessor of 
section 92, section 58A of the Trademarks Act 1938, also plainly covered grey market goods. The 
appellants’ contention therefore that the more stringent test for int ention in s.58A had the practical 
effect of confining criminal liability to cases of their category of “true counterfeits” must be 
rejected.  [16-17] 
 
There is therefore no ambiguity in the language of the section to justify investigating the 
Parliamentary debate at the passing of the 1994 Act. In any event, the appellants did not contend 
that Parliament considered a difference between true counterfeits and grey market goods. Still less 
is there any point at which it can be suggested that Parliament plainly confined itself to 
criminalising fake goods and abjured the criminalising of grey market goods. The authorities relied 
on by the appellants in support of their contention that such a distinction was plainly intended do 
not assist here, as they were not add ressing any difference between fake goods and unauthorised 
goods on the grey market, and moreover came years after the passage of the 1994 Act so could not 
have been in mind at the time of its passing.  [13-14] 
 
The appellants are correct that in the contex t of goods which a proprietor voluntarily puts into the 
European single market with his trademark attached , section 12 of the 1994 Act, transposing article 
7 of Directive 89/104/EEC, has the effect that further objection to the use of the mark is limited 
to special cases, such as changes or impairments to the goods. But that is true whichever of the 
rival constructions of section 92 is correct. Where it applies, this concept of exhaustion means that 
there is no infringement of the mark as a matter of civil law, and thus no criminal offence. But this 
sheds no light on the correct construction of section 92.  [15] 
 
There is no reason to strain the construction of s.92(1) to exclude the sale of grey market goods. 
This is not because of the supposedly adverse con sequences which the Crown argued would 
follow, some of which would be as likely to e nsue even on the correct interpretation of the section. 
The distinction between the two categories suggested by the appellant is not cut and dried, but both 
are clear infri ngements of the rights of the trademark proprietor. The plain meaning of the Act is  
that it is  unlawful to put “grey goods ” on the market just as it is to put fake ones on there. In both 
cases the trader is setting out to profit from someone else’s tradema rk without permission. [18] 
 
In the alternative, the appellants contend that the Crown’s construction of section 92(1) involves a 
disproportionate breach of their rights under article 1, Protocol 1 to the European Convention on 
Human Rights. But the 1994 A ct does not deprive them of their property, as it does not stop them 
selling the goods, except if they wish to do so whilst still with the misleading and infringing 
trademark attached. Such regulation  of use or disposal of goods is permitted under the seco nd 
paragraph of article 1 in the general interest , and is in any event a proportionate measure, striking a 
legitimate balance between the rights of the proprietor to protect his valuable trademark, and those 
of the person who wishes to sell good which he h as bought.  [19]

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT S 
 
Principles  
 
To stifle an appeal is to impose a condition which prevents an appellant from bringing it or continuing 
it. If an ap pellant has permission to bring  an appeal, it is wrong to impose a condition which has the 
effect of preventing him from bringing it or continuing it. For the purposes of Article 6 of the 
European Convention on Human Rights, there will seldom be a “fair he aring” if a court which has 
permitted a litigant to b ring an appeal then, by indirect means, does not permit him to bring it [12]. 
The appellant must  establish on the balance of probabilities that a proposed condition would stifle the 
continuat ion of its a ppeal [15]. The courts can proceed on the basis that, were it to be established that 
the condition would probably stifle the appeal, the condition should not be imposed [16]. 
 
Even if an appellant appears to have no realisable assets, a condition for payme nt will not stifle its 
appeal if it can raise the sum [17]. However, the court must  be cautious in respect of a suggestion that 
a corporate appellant can raise money from its controlling shareholder . The shareholder’s distinct legal 
personality  must remain  in the forefront of its analysis. The question should always be whether the 
company can raise the money and never whether the shareholder can raise the money [18]. The 
criterion which should  be applied is as follows: “Has the appellant company established  on the balance 
of probabilities that no such funds would be made available to it, whether by its owner or by some 
other closely associated person, as would enable it to satisfy the requested condition?” [23]. 
 
Where a company and/or its owner denies that the necessary funds would be made available to the 
company, the court should not take that assertion at face value. It should judge the probable 
availability of the funds by reference to the underlying realities of the company’s financial position and 
to its relationship with its owner, including the extent to which he is directing its affairs and is 
supporting it in financial terms [24]. 
 
Application  of principles  to the present case  
 
The appellant’s application for discharge of the condition was refused b y reference to the incorrect 
criterion . Patten LJ proceeded by reference to the  Court of Appeal’s  misconception in Hammond 
Suddard  Solicitors v Agrichem International Holdings  Ltd [2011] EWCA Civ 2065  and Societe Generale  SA v 
Saad Trading, Contracting and  Financial Services Co and Al -Sanea [2012] EWCA Civ 695 , that in exceptional 
circumstances an order for a party, without apparent assets of its own, to make a payment into court 
could be justified by whether another person probably could advance the necess ary funds to it 
irrespective of whether he probably would  do so [25]. 
 
Dissenting Judgments  
 
Lord Clarke  and Lord Carnwath would have dismissed the appeal. Patten LJ did not materially misstate  
the rele vant principles or arrive  at the wrong conclusion [27, 46]. Where a company does not have 
resources of its own and the issue is whether it has access to the resources of others, the question is 
whether the company would (not could) have ha d access to the resources [42]. There was no direct 
evidence from Mr Ba gana on the question of whether he would have declined to provide funds. The 
evidence falls far short of establishing that the condition would stifle the appeal [44, 48].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The background to the introduction of  section 49  was the anomaly that nursing care was either 
provided free by the NHS or bought in by the local authority or residents depending on where it was 
provided. It was intended to shift the boundary further in the direction of NHS funding, but the wo rds 
at the end of s 49(2) could not be ignored [26].  
 
If Parliament  had wanted to restrict the definition of ‘nursing care by a registered nurse’ to tasks which 
could only be performed by a registered nurse then it could and would have said so [36]. Equal ly, if it 
had wanted to prohibit local authorities from paying for anything done by a registered nurse in a care 
home, it also could and w ould have said this [37]. Instead s 49  began with the broad concept of ‘any 
services provided by a registered nurse’ a nd then limited those services in two ways . The first was  to 
services which ‘involve’ the care of residents ie looking after them, inc luding personal and social care. 
The second was  to exclude services which ‘having regard to their nature and the circumsta nces in 
which they are provided do not need to be provided by a registered nurse ’. This latter category 
envisages that there will also be circumstances in which some personal or non -nursing care will need to 
be provided by a registered nurse, care which is  associated with or ancillary to the nursing care she is 
providing  [38].  
 
The provision of an overall, holistic, person -centred plan for each resident who needs some nursing 
care requires the nurse to engage in social and personal tasks as part of that ca re. Some caring tasks 
cannot sensibly be parcelled up between nursing and non -nursing care. It is a matter of fact, and one 
for the decision makers, what part of the care provided by registered nurses will fall within this 
definition [39-41]. Time spent on  paid breaks  and on receiving supervision is , however, a necessary 
part of providing the services registered nurses are there to provide [42].  
 
Accordingly, the correct interpretation of s 49 is that ‘ nursing care by a registered nurse ’ covers (a) 
time sp ent directly or indirectly on nursing care, in the sense of care which can only be provided by a 
registered nurse; (b) paid breaks; (c) time receiving supervision; (d) stand -by time; and (e) time spent 
on providing, planning, supervising or delegating the provision of other types of care which in all the 
circumstances ought to be provided by a registered nurse because they are ancillary to or closely 
connected with or part and parcel of the nursing care which she has to provide [44].  
 
The Boards’ decision was therefore based on a misinterpretation of s 49(2) and must be quashed and 
retaken in the light of this guidance, ideally after negotiation with all the parties governed by the 
legislation and with an interest in the outcome [46].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal , but does not approve all the reasoning of the 
Court of Appeal.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
It would be  appropriate for an appellate court to interfere with Judge Mosedale’s full and carefully 
considered judgment if it could be shown that irrelevant material was taken in to account, relevant 
material was ignored (unless the appellate court was satisfied that this made no difference), or the 
decision was one which no reasonable trib unal court have reached [21]. 
 
The order made by Judge Hellier reflects the terms of rule 8(3)(a) of Rule 8 of the Tribunal Procedure 
(First -tier Tribunal) (Tax Chamber) Rules 2009 (SI 2009/273), which provides that: “the Tribunal may 
strike out the whole or a part of the proceedings if – (a) the appellant has failed to comply with a 
direction which stated that a failure by the appellant to comply with the direction could lead to the 
striking out of the proceedings or part of them” [10-11]. Judge Mosedale h ad correctly approached the 
issue on the basis that the order reflected  rule 8(3), rather than rule 8(1) as HMRC had contended [22].  
 
Case law concerning  time-limits and sanctions relevant to  the Civil Procedure Rules do es not apply 
directly  to the tribun als: the jurisdiction of many of the tribunals extends to the whole of the United 
Kingdom rather than being limited to England and Wales, and they have  different rules from the 
courts and sometimes require a different approach t o a particular procedural is sue. However,  in 
general , a similar  approach  should be followed  [23-26]. Judge Mosedale  had made clear that her 
consideration of the Civil Procedure Rules and related  authorities was limited to whether the guidance 
contained in them was relevant by analogy  to the application of the overriding objective in the Tax 
Tribunal rules. She had distinguished the guidance before applying a nuanced version of it [26-27]. 
Further, i n considering the reasoning in Mitchell v Newsgroup Limited [2014] 1 WLR 795, Judge Mos edale 
had correctly considered that whilst the case was not strictly relevant, it contained some useful 
guidance when considering the overriding objective of dealing with cases fairly and justly [28], [15]. 
There is no basis for concluding that she had mis understood the guidance given in Mitchell, nor that 
any developments in the subsequent case of Denton  v TH White Ltd [2014] 1 WLR 3926  justified  
upsetting her decision [28].  
 
In reaching her conclusion , Judge Mosedale had carefully cons idered all the rele vant factors, including 
the disadvantage to HMRC and the arguably disproportionate benefit to BPP [29], [12-20]. The fact 
that HMRC was discharging a public duty in this case did not justify the application of  a special rule or 
approach [30]. It was not di sproportionate for BPP to have sought a debarring order rather than 
proceeding to a hearing [31]. The  argument that the result of the debarring order would result in an 
unjustified windfall for BPP  by improving its prospects of success in the substantive a ppeal  could be 
made by any party facing a debarring order , and would , if accepted, save in exceptional circumstances, 
undermine the utility of the sanction of a debarring order [32]. The decision to make a debarring order 
against HMRC was tough and some Ft -T judges may not have made it. However, HMRC cannot cross 
the high hurdle of demonstrating that the decision was unjustifiable, given the combination of the 
nature and extent of HMRC’s failure to reply to BPP’s request, the length of the delay in rectifyi ng the 
failure and the length of the consequential delay to the proceedings, the absence of any remedy to 
compensate BPP for the delay and the absence of any explanation or excuse for the failure, coupled 
with the existence of other failures by HMRC to com ply with directions [33-34].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
It was important to identify  the different  rights the appellants individually enjoyed, and thus  what the 
Secretary of State ne eded to establish in order  to remove them:  
• Ms Sado vska had  a right of permanent residence in the UK and c ould no t be expelled unless 
she ha d abused her rights  within the meaning of article 35 of the Directive . A Communication 
in 2014 from the European Comm ission giving guidance on the Directive explained that a  
‘marriage of convenience ’ was a marriage contracted with the predominant purpose of enjoying 
the right of free movement . It was not enough that the marriage might bring incidental 
immigration and oth er benefits , and the predominant purpose must be the purpose of both 
parties [21-24, 29] . 
• Mr Malik was liable to be removed as an over -stayer. Had he succeeded in marrying Ms 
Sadovska he would have acquired a right of residence in the UK under the Directiv e as a 
family member of an EU national working h ere. The Directive also required  member states to 
facilitate the entry and residence of the partner of an EU citizen if it wa s ‘a durable 
relationship, duly attested’ [25-26]. 
• Both appellants enjoy ed rights u nder articles 8 and 12 of the European Convention on Human 
Rights to a private and family life, and to marry and found a family [27].   
 
The 2006 Regulations permitted the Secretary of State to take steps to remove Ms Sadovska on the 
basis of reasonable gr ounds to suspect that she had entered or attempted to enter a marriage of 
convenience, but she was entitled to an appeal where the facts and circumstances were fully 
investigated. The tribunal had to form its own view of the facts from the evidence present ed. It was 
not for her to establish that her relationship with Mr Malik was a genuine and lasting one, but for the 
Secretary o f State to establish that it fell within the definition of  a marriage of convenience [28]. The 
tribunal had also to be satisfied t hat the removal  of Ms Sadovska from the country where she had lived 
and worked for so long with other family members would be a proportionate response to the abuse of 
rights, rather than merely the prevention of the marriage [30]. As the tribunal had not a nalysed Ms 
Sadovska’s rights this way,  it was not possible for the Supreme Court to conclude that the Secretary of 
State had proved that the narrow grounds for taking away her established rights existed [31].  
 
Mr Malik had no established rights but  if he could produce  evidence of a durable relationship with Ms 
Sadovska , it would be for the Secretary of State to show that it was not , or that there were other good 
reasons to deny him entry. Again , the Supreme Court could not conclude that, had his case been 
approached in the right way, the outcome would have inevitably been the same [32-33]. 
 
Accordingly, the burden of proof of establishing that the proposed marriage is one of convenience 
falls on the Secretary of State. The appeal i s allowed and the case rem itted for a fu ll rehearing by the 
First-tier T ribunal, at which the inconsistencies in the appellants’ interviews will be considered along 
with the ir evidence supportive of a genuine re lationship dating back several months , and t he 
circumstances in which t he interviews took place  will also be taken into account  [34].  
 
The appellants’ ECHR rights did not add anything further to their claims in the light of this 
conclusion . Such rights would not in any event prevent a state from taking steps to prevent sham 
marriages, if it could show that the marriage would indeed be a sham [35].

The description of the application as being to “vary” the wife’s undertaking is confused. The court’s 
power is only to grant or refuse an application for release  from the undertaking. Although the court’s 
exercise of its power may result in something which looks like a variation of an undertaking, if it 
decides to accept a further undertaking, it is the product of a different process of reasonin g [5]. 
 
The courts below wrongly concluded that they did not have jurisdiction to release the wife from her 
undertaking . They failed to distinguish between the existence of the court’s jurisdiction to release the 
wife from her undertaking, and the exercise  of its jurisdiction [6]. The case law indicates that there is full 
jurisdiction to hear the wife’s application [12]. Further, in circumstances where the undertaking in para 
4.4 could have been framed as a n order  for sale of the property  under  section 24A  of the Act , variable 
under section 31(2)(f) , it would be illogical for the existence and exercise of jurisdiction  to grant release 
from the undertaking  to differ from those in relation to the variation of any such order [17-18]. The 
equivalence  of the wife ’s para 4.4 undertaking wi th a section 24A order for sale  seems clearly to 
confirm the existence of the court’s jurisdiction to hear her application for release from it [19]. Lord 
Wilson is unable to subscribe to the Court of Appeal ’s determination of the appeal  in Omielan by 
reference to the non -existence of jurisdiction rather than a refusal  to exercise its  jurisdiction. Where 
Parliament has conferred jurisdiction on a court, there is no scope for a court to say part of it does not 
exist.  The terms of a f inancial order are often interlinked and therefore it is difficult to apply the 
concept of different territories to such an order. The demarcation of territories within the order is no 
proper criterion for identifying the existence of a jurisdiction [27]. 
 
Parliament did not in section 31(7) or elsewhere in the Act make a change of circumstances a 
condition for the exercise of jurisdiction to vary a section 24A(1)  order for  sale. However, unless there 
has been a significant change of circumstances since the  order was made, grounds for variation of it 
under section 31 seem hard to conceive [15].  
 
The court remits to HHJ Waller the inquiry into whether the court’s jurisdiction to vary the 
undertaking should be exercised. In light of the equivalence of the wife’s undertaking with a section 
24A order for sale, his inquiry will be conducted in accordance with section 31(7) of the Act. He will 
give first consideration to the welfare of the two children; but it is a consideration which may be 
outweighed by other fa ctors. He will have regard to all relevant circumstances including in particular, 
whether the wife can establish a significant change of circumstances since her undertaking was given 
and whether, and if so to what extent, the husband has suffered, and is l ikely to continue to suffer, 
prejudice by remaining liable under his mortgage covenants [29]. If the court finds that the husband 
has suffered , and/or would be likely to suffer , prejudice as a result of delay in selling the home , the 
court might favour com pensating him by asking the wife to make provision for him out of the ultimate 
net proceeds as a condition of release [30]. 
 
Lord Hughes gives a dissent ing judgment , not on the existence of the jurisdiction to vary a section 24A  
order for sale, or its equi valent achieved via an undertaking, but on the principles for its exercise . It 
must be kept in mind that the section 24A order is ancillary to a capital order and that final capital 
orders cannot be varied in their substance (whether or not there is a chan ge of circumstances). Lord 
Hughes states that the acid test should be whether the application is in substance (impermissibly) to 
vary or alter the final order or whether  it is (permissibly) to support it by working out how it should be 
carried into effect [54]. The application in the present case is one which attempts to vary, not to carry 
into effect, the originally agreed and court -endorsed order and therefore the Court of Appeal was right 
to hold that it was bound to fail [57]. Lord Hughes would dismiss the appeal [58].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The “period of membership” in regulation 4 of the 2000 Regulations refers to the period of the 
person’s membership of the pension arrangement, whether or not contri butions are being made in that 
period [31]. There are four reasons why “membership” should not be confined to active membership 
of pension  scheme while the  member was contributing to it  [25].  
 
First, interpreting regulation 4 as confined in such a way inv olves adding words which are not there. 
The person who drafted the 2000 Regulations was clearly aware of the different categories of 
membership , as can be observed from the differentiation between categories of membership in 
regulation 3,  and chose not to differentiate in regulation 4 between classes of membership [26].  
 
Secondly, the 2000 Regulations apply to both occupational pension schemes and personal pension 
schemes. The definition of “active membership ” in section 124(1) of the Pensions Act 1995 mak es no 
sense in relation to personal pension schemes. It must be assumed that Parliament intended the 
Regulations to operate sensibly in respect of differing pension schemes. Further, it would prove 
difficult to ascertain  the point at which a party who has made occasional contributions to a personal 
pension scheme had chosen to cease to make contributions [27].  
 
Thirdly, the reading of the word “active” or “contributing” into regulation 4  cannot be supported by 
referring to the focus in section 10(4) of the  1985 Act to the acquisition by the parties of assets during 
the marriage but before the relevant date. Section 10(5) of the 1985 Act deals specifically with 
pensions, and the opening words of section 10(4), which defines ‘matrimonial property’, state that the 
definition provided in section 10(4) is  “subject to subsection (5) below”. Parliament chose to deal with 
pensions differently by making a separate provision for them in section 10(5) . It follows from  the 
creation of that separate provision  that the de finition in section 10(4) should not be considered to 
apply to pensio ns and, therefore,  the majority of the Extra Division of the Inner House  erred in its 
reliance on it .  
 
Fourthly, it is not persuasive that “membership” in regulation 4 must mean active m embership in 
order to give meaning to the statement that factor B can be zero. If the person drafting the wording of 
factors B and C in regulation 4 intended to confine “membership” in such a way that would be 
remarkably indirect. There is no hint of such an intention in the words of the Regulations . Further, 
confining “the period of membership” to the period when contributions were made and apportioning 
the value of the rights or interests in the benefits by reference to time, as section 10(5) requires, ma y 
often create an apportionment of the rights of interests in benefits in personal pension schemes which 
bears no relationship to the relative value of the rights acquired before and during the marriage  [30].  
 
This interpretation does not mean that the va lue of an interest in a pension must be shared equally. 
Section 9(1) of the 1985 Act contains other principles which inform the court’s decision -making and 
introduces flexibility into the award of financial provision. Further flexibility is introduced by t he 
recognition in section 10(1) that there may be special circumstances for departing from the equal 
sharing of matrimonial property [13, 32].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGME NT 
 
The Fees Order is unlawful under both domestic and EU law because it has the effect of 
preventing access to justice. Since it had that effect as soon as it was made, it was therefore 
unlawful  and must be quashed.   
 
The constitutional right of access to  the courts is in herent in the rule of law: it is needed to ensure 
that the laws created by Parliament and the courts are applied  and enforced.  Tribunals are more 
than merely the providers of a servic e which is only of value to those who bring claims  befor e them 
[65-85]. As a matter of domestic law, the Fees Order is unlawful if there is a real risk that persons 
will effectively be prevented from having access to justice, or if the degree of intrusion into access 
to justice is greater than is justified by  the purposes of the Fees Order [86-89]. 
 
While court fees for small claims are related to the value of the claim, the ET and EAT fees bear no 
direct relation to the amount sought and can therefore be expected to act as a deterrent to claims 
for modest amoun ts or non-monetary remedies (which together form the majority of ET claims ). 
The recoverability of costs upon success cannot be decisive of  the question of access to justice as 
that right is not restricted to the abi lity to bring successful claims  [20-37]. Indeed the evidence 
before the Court show s that the effect  of the Fees Order was a dramatic and persistent fall in the 
number of claims brought in ETs, with a greater fall in the number of lower value claims and 
claims in which a financial remedy was not sought. Fees were the most frequently cited reason for 
not submitting a claim.  Worked examples of the impact of fees on hypothetical claimants indicated 
that in order to meet the fees they would have to restrict expenditure that was ordinary and 
reasonable  for maintaining living  standards  [38-55]. 
 
The question of whether fees effectively prevent access to justice must be decided according to the 
likely impact of the fees on behaviour in the real world. Fees must be affordable not in a theoretical 
sense, bu t in the sense that they can reasonably be afforded. Where households on low to middle 
incomes can only afford fees by forgoing an acceptable standard of living, the fees cannot be 
regarded as affordable.  Even where fees are affordable, they prevent access  to justice where they 
render it futile or irrational to bring a claim, for example where in claims for modest or no financial 
awards no sensible claimant w ill bring a claim unless he can be virtually certain he will succeed, that 
the award will include recovery of fees, and that the award will be satisfied in full  [90-98]. Further, 
although the stated purposes of the Fees Order are legitimate aims, it ha s not been shown that the 
Fees Order was the least intrusive means of achieving those aims [99-103]. The Fees Order is also 
unlawful because it contravene s the EU law guarantee  of an effective  remedy before a tribunal : it 
imposes disproportionate limitation s on the enforcement  of EU employment rights [105-117]. 
 
The Fees Order is i ndirectly di scriminatory un der the Equality Act 2010  because the higher fees for 
type B claims put women at a particular disadvantage, because a hi gher proportion of women bring 
type B than bring t ype A claims . The charging of  higher fees was not a proportionate means of 
achieving t he stated aims of the Fees Order . It had not been shown to be more effective at 
transferring the cost of the s ervice from taxpayers to users, and in some type B cases (such as 
pregnancy dismissal) the higher fee did not correspond to  a greater workload pla ced on the 
tribunal. Further, m eritorious as well as unmeritorious claims might be deterred by the higher price, 
and there was no correlation between  the higher fee and the merits of th e case or incentives to 
settle [121-134].

The Supreme Court , Lord Mance giving its unanimous judgment,  allows  the appeal  in part but, on the 
critical question of whether it was lawful to require payment of the l arger refundable a mounts  with the 
applications , makes a reference to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Court concludes that: 
 
(1) Paragraph 19 of schedule 3 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 
enable s a licencing authority to impose on  an applicant a fee for the grant or renewal of a 
licence which cover s the running and enforcement co sts of the  licensing scheme , to be payable  
either (a) at the time when the licence is granting; or (b) on a refundable basis, at the time when 
the application is lodged [7]. 
 
(2) Article 13(2)  of Directive 2006/123/EC  deals only with authorisation procedures  and fees 
relating to  applica tions for permission to access or exercise a service activity , such as operating 
a sex shop . It does not prevent the imposi tion on those who receive l icences of proportionate 
charges  to fund the cost of administering and enforcing the licensing regime [15]-[17].  
 
(3) As to the legitimacy of Westminster ’s system, it is helpful to distinguish between two types of 
scheme. Under Type A, applications for licenc es are made  on terms that the applica nt must, 
upon their application being granted, pay a fee to cover the cost of administering and enforcing 
the licensing regime. Under Type B, which represents the scheme actually adopted by 
Westminster, applications for  licences are made  on terms that the applicant  must, at the time of 
making the application, pay a fee, refundable in the event that the application fails, to cover the 
cost of administering and enforcing the licensing regime [18].   
 
(4) Type A schemes are  permissible under regulation 18(4) of the Provision of Services Regulation 
2009 SI No 2999 and article 13(2) of Directive 2006/123/EC , because  they permit a  licensing 
authority to charge a successful applicant  with a proportionate part of the cost of administ ering 
and enforcing the licensing regime as a whole [19]. 
 
(5) Whether article 13 (2) also permits T ype B schemes  is more problematic, because payment is 
required to be made by every applicant, albeit on a potentially refundable basis, at the time 
when the application is made. There was no evidence that  a Type B scheme could or would 
have a potentially dissuasive effect upon applicants but it remains unclear whether it involves 
in law a “charge ” incurred fro m the application, contrary to a rticle 13(2)  [20]-[24].  
 
(6) A reference to the Court of Justice is therefore required on whether and when a Ty pe B 
scheme is consistent with a rticle 13(2). The parties are invited to make proposals on the 
wording of the question to be referred  [25].

By a majority of 5 to 2 , the Supreme Court  dismisses the a ppeal .  Lord Sumption gives the judgment, with

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
With limited exceptions, the English courts administer  judgments in public, at hearings which any member 
of the public may attend and which the press may report [12].  Th e limits on permissible reporting of 
public legal proceedings are set by the law of contempt, defamation and th e law  protecting ECHR rights 
[17].  The present appeal turns on the last category.  In Campbell v MGN Ltd , the House of Lords 
expanded the scope of the equitable action for breach of confidence by absorbing into it the values 
underlying articles 8 (right to respect for private and fam ily life) and 10 (freedom of expression) of the 
ECHR.  This effectively recognised a qualif ied common law right of privacy [21]. 
 
The legal basis of the judge’s analysis was challenged in two respects.  Firstly, it was argued that the 
decision of the Supre me Court in A v British Broadcasting Corporation  marked a new approach to the 
balancing test between competing rights laid out  in In re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) .  In A the 
Court had dismissed the BBC’s application to lift an order pr ohibiting identification of a deportee who 
had been convicted of child sex offences because it would not only have violated his article 2 and 3 ECHR 
rights, but would have also subverted the basis of the decision to authorise his deportation.    That 
argume nt fails  in the present case  because while A turned on very particular facts, the general approach 
adopted in Lord Reed’s leading judgment  was in fact very similar to that of Lord Rodger in In re Guardian 
News and Media Ltd  [28, 33] .  The second argument w as that in adopting Lord Rodger’s observations in In 
re Guardian News and Media Ltd  about the public’s ability to distinguish between suspicion and guilt, the 
judge had applied a legal presumption which was not warranted.  This also fails: Lord Rodger was not 
presenting this as a legal presumption to be applied irrespective of the circumstances.  This part of the 
judge’s reasoning was doing no more than saying that while some members of the public would equate 
suspicion with guilt, most would not [33]. 
 
The judge committed no error of law, and was entitled to reach the conclusion that he did  [34].  The 
appellant seeks to prohibit the reporting of matters discussed at public trial.  These are not matters about 
which he can have had any reasonable expectation of privacy  [34(1)] .  The impact on the appellant’s 
family life is indirect and incidental: neither he nor his family participated in any capacity at trial, and 
nothing that was said at trial related to his family.  It would be incoherent for the law to ref use an 
injunction to prevent damage to the appellant’s reputation directly, while granting it to prevent the 
collateral impact on his family life in the same circumstances [34(3)] .  Lord Sumption would not, 
however, rule out the possibility of a pre -emptiv e injunction in a case where the information was private 
or there was no sufficiently substantial public interest in publication.  Such cases will be rare in relation to 
the reporting of public court proceedings [34(4)] .  
 
The public interest  in allowing the press reporting of court proceedings extend s to the appellant’s identity.  
The policy which permits media reporting on judicial proceedings depends on (i) the right of the public to 
be informed about a significant public act of the state, and (ii) the law’s recognition that the way in which 
the story is presented is a matter of editorial judgment.  The appellant’s identity is not an irrelevant feature 
of this particular story [34(5)] . 
 
In their dissenting judgment, Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson  consider tha t the judge had erred  in his 
approach to balancing the strength of the rival considerations [39].  They  take the view that Lord Rodger  
was stating a legal presumption that courts should act on the basis that most people believe that someone 
charged with an  offence is innocent until proven guilty [44-5], but that he had offered no evidence or 
authority to support such a presumption . Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson conclude that there was no basis for 
the presumption and , accordingly , the judge erred  in dismissing the appellant’s application because of it .  
Their Lordships also indicate th at, under article 8,  it is likely  that the appellant would  have established his 
right to an injunction at full trial [59].

REASONS  FOR THE DECISION  
 
On direct infringement, Article 1 of t he Protocol on the Inter pretation of Article 69(1) EPC provides 
that the scope of protection afforded to a patentee is not to be limited by the literal meaning of the 
claims. Article 2 provides that there can be a difference between  the interpreted scope of a claim and 
the scope of protection afforded by it, and when considering the scope of protection equivalents must 
be taken in to account  [33-34]. Further guidance is needed to guide a court through  this exercise [53]. 
 
Whether an item  direct ly infringe s a patent  is best approached b y addressing two question s through 
the eyes of the notional addressee of the patent, i.e. the person skilled in the relevant art , namely : 
1.  Does the item infringe any of t he claims as a matter of no rmal interpretation; and if not,  
2.  Although the item may be characterised as a  variant,  does it  nonetheless infringe because it 
varies from the invention in a way which is immaterial?  
If the answer to either question is “yes”, there is an infringement; otherwise there is not  [54].  
 
On question  1, according to normal principles of interpretation the Actavis products do not infringe 
the Patent [58].  
 
Question 2  raises  the issue of equivalents and poses a more difficult question of  principle [59]. The 
following questions should be considered by a court  as a guide  to the question of materiality  [66]:  
1. Notwithstanding that it is not within the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent, 
does the variant achieve substantial ly the same result in substantially the same way as the 
invention, i.e. the inventive concept revealed by the patent?   
2. Would it be obvious to the person skilled in the art, reading the patent at the priority date, but 
knowing that the variant achieves subs tantially the same result as the invention, that it does so 
in substantially the same way as the invention?   
3. Would such a reader of the patent have concluded that the patentee nonetheless intended strict 
compliance with the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent was an essential 
requirement of the invention?  
To establish infringement where there is no literal infringement , a patentee would have to establish 
that the answer to the first two questions was “yes” and the answer to the third was “no” [66].  
 
The Actavis products  directly  infringe  the Patent  [68]. They all involve a medicament containing the 
pemetrexed anion and vitamin B12 , and achieve substantially the same result in substantially the same 
way as the invention. Once he or she knew that the Actavis products achieved substantially the same 
result as the invention, the notional addressee of the Patent would have thought it obvious that this 
was so, particularly as he or she would have regarded investigating whether pemetrexed free ac id, 
pemetrexed ditromethamine or pemetrexed dipotassium worked as a routine exercise [69]. On the 
third question, the Court of Appeal had placed too much weight on the words of the claim. It is very 
unlikely that the notional addressee would have concluded  that the patentee could have intended to 
exclude any pemetrexed salts other than pemetrexed disodium from the scope of protection [70-74]. 
Direct infringement is also established under French, Spanish and Italian law [92-102]. 
 
Recourse to the contents of  the prosecution file by a UK court will only b e appropriate in limited 
circumstances , particularly if they clearly resolve a genuine ambiguity in the patent or it would be 
contrary to the public interest to disregard the file [87-88]. The contents of the file do not justify 
departing from the conclusion in this case [89].  
 
In the circumstances, Actavis’ cross -appeal does not arise. However, the Supreme Court would have 
upheld the Court of Appeal’s determination that Actavis are liable to Lilly for indirec t infringement in 
the United Kingdom  [103-112].

Lord Kerr (with whom Lady Hale and Lord Reed agree) gives the lead judgment .  Lord Carnwath and 
Lord Hughes give a judgment concurring in part.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
EU Directive 2000/78/EC (the Framework Directive)  requires member states to prohibit  
discrimination in the field of employment and occupation on various grounds including sexual 
orientation. The deadline for transposing the Directive into domestic law was 2 December 2003 and 
the UK did this within the deadline  through legislation now incorporated into Part 5 of the Equality 
Act 2010  [17].  Parliament also , however, provided for the exception  now contained in paragraph 18 of 
Schedule 9 to the 2010 Act restricting benefits payable in respect of periods of service before 5 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 December 2005 . The essential question in this appeal is whether paragraph 18  of Schedule  9 is 
incompatible with the Framework Directive [ 20-21]. 
 
Although EU law does not impose any requirement on member states to recognise same -sex 
partnerships, the European Court of Justice (CJEU) has held that if a status equivalent to marriage is 
availabl e under national law, it is directly discriminatory contrary to the Framework Directive for an 
employer to treat a same -sex partner who is in such a partnership less favourably than an opposite -sex 
spouse . In the UK, Parliament has chosen to recognise same -sex partnerships, first through the 
introduction of civil partnerships and subsequently through the recognition of same -sex marriage itself 
[17-19]. 
 
The general rule  under EU law , as in most modern legal systems, is that legislative changes apply 
prospec tively.  The CJEU  has developed two principles to establish the temporal application of EU 
legislation - the “no retroactivity” principle and the “future effects” principle  [22-23].  These principles 
draw  a distinction  between the retroactive application o f legislation to past situations (which is 
prohibited unless expressly provided for) and its immediate application to continuing situations (which 
is generally permitted).   The relevant question is whether the legal situation has become “permanently 
fixed ” [25].  The application of these principles presents a challenge when one is dealing with 
entitlement to an occupational retirement pension, the right to which may accumulate over decades  
and it may not be easy to identify the point at which it becomes “p ermanently fixed” [26]. 
 
The Court of Appeal, in dismissing Mr Walker’s appeal , wrongly concluded that entitlement to a 
survivor’s pension is “permanently fixed” at the date of retirement  [43].  It was influenced in this view 
by a line of the CJEU’s case l aw exceptionally limiting the temporal application of one of its judgments 
relating to equal pay for men and women  (the Barber  line of case law) .  In the opinion  of the majority  
of the Court , these cases are not relevant to the application of the Framework  Directive  in a case such 
as this .  How the CJEU  exceptionally applies a temporal limitation to one of its rulings  has no 
inevitable bearing on the temporal application of legislation as a matter of principle  [46]. 
 
In any event, two recent decisions of th e Grand Chamber of the CJEU  concerning the equal treatment 
rights of same -sex partners  to survivor’s  pensions put success for Mr Walker’s claim beyond doubt  
(Case C -267/06 Maruko v Versorgungsanstalt der Deutschen Bühnen  and Case C -147/08 Römer v Freie und  
Hansestadt Hamburg ) [46].  From these cases , it is clear that, unless evidence establishes that there would 
be unacceptable economic or social consequences of giving effect to Mr Walker’s entitlement to a 
survivor’s pension for his husband, at the time th at this pension would fall due, there is no reason that 
he should be subjected to unequal treatment as to the payment of that pension  [55].  Mr Walker’s 
husband, provided he does not predecease him, and that they remain married at the time of Mr 
Walker’s d eath, is therefore entitled under the Framework Directive to a spouse’s pension calculated 
on the basis of all the years of Mr Walker’s service with Innospec. On that account, paragraph 18 of 
Schedule 9 , in so far as it authorises a restriction of payment of benefits based on periods of service 
before 5 December 2005,  is incompatible with the Framework Directive  and must be disapplied  [77].  
 
Lord Carnwath and Lord Hughes agree with the majority that Mr Walker’s appeal should be allowed, 
but on the more lim ited basis that the question of who qualified as his spouse fell to be determined 
after the Directive had come into force.  They prefer to leave the broader question of whether the 
Barber  line of case law is of any relevance to the application of the Frame work Directive to be 
determined by the CJEU in O’Brien v Ministry of Justice  [2017] UKSC 46 , in which the C ourt has decided 
to refer to the CJEU a question relating to the pension entitlement of part -time workers  [77-78].

The Supreme Court unanimously decides to refer a question  to the CJEU. The terms of the reference 
are set out by Lord Reed . 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Supreme Court is not persuaded that the case of either appellant or respondent is clearly right and 
is therefore under a duty to refer the qu estions in issue to the CJEU.  
 
As a matter of EU law when a new rule of law comes into force, it cannot apply to legal situations 
which  have arisen and become definitive prior to that date, but can apply to the future effects of a 
situation which arose under the old law (European Commission v Moravia Gas Storage AS  (Case C -596/13 
P). This principle was applied in Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS) v Bruno  (Joined Cases C -The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Sq uare London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 395/08 and C -396/08 ), where it was held that periods of employment completed before the directive 
came into force should be taken into account in calculating whether an employee’s length of service 
qualifie d for a pension . The entitlement to a pension (or lack thereof) based on periods of employment 
under the old law was not a situation which arose and became definitive at the time of the 
employment, but was a future effect of that employment. Mr O’Brien a rgues that under this line of 
reasonin g, periods of employment before the directive entered into force are to be taken into account 
when applying the directive in situations which arise after it should have been transposed , not only in 
relation to qualificat ion for a retirement pension (which the Ministry does not dispute), but also in 
relation to the quantification of that pension, where its quantification is based on the employee’s length 
of service.  
 
However, the CJEU has also treated occupational pensions  as a deferred form of pay, the entitlement 
to which accrues continuously over the employee’s service (Ten Oever v Stichting Bedrijfspensionenfonds voor 
her Glazenwassers en Schoonmaakbedrijf (Case C-109/91 ). In Ten Oever the Court referred to its judgment  in 
Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance Group judgment  (Case C -262/88)  on the requirement for equal 
treatment of men and women  in occupational pensions (pursuant to a different EU law pr ovision), and 
held that such equal treatment could be claimed o nly in relation to benefits in respect of periods of 
employment subsequent to the date of the Barber judgment. The Ministry argue d that following Ten 
Oever  an occupational  pension constitutes deferred pay for past work, and the worker’s entitlement to 
that pension accrues and is fixed at the time of the wor k for which it constitutes pay ; the entitlement is 
not determined when the person retires and the pension becomes payable. The EU law principle of 
non-retroactivity therefore prevents the right which accr ued (or did not accrue) at the time of service 
from being affected retrospectively by a change in the law. On that basis, it is argued that Mr O’Brien’s 
non-entitlement to a pension in respect of his first 22 years of service was definitively established 
before the directive entered into force.  
 
In the context of these two approaches, t he Supreme Co urt is inclined to think that the effect of the 
directive is that it is unlawful to discriminate against part -time workers when a retirement pension falls 
due fo r payment. The directive applies where the pension falls due for payment after the directive has 
entered into force. In so far as part of the period of service took place prior to the directive’s entry into 
force, the directive applies to the future effect s of that situation.  However, the CJEU has not yet 
considered the argument that if, following the Ten Oever  line of authority, an occupational pension is 
treated as deferred pay, the right to which is acquired at the time of the work to which the pay relat es, 
then it follows from the general principle of non -retroactivity that the directive does not alter or affect 
rights acquired (or, in Mr O’Brien’s case, not acquired) before it was brought into force, there being no 
provision in the directive which overr ides that general principle. Although the majority of the court are 
inclined to think that Ten Oever  was concerned with the exceptional Barber  limitation, which does not 
arise in the present context, the correct approach does not appear to the Supreme Cour t to be 
sufficiently clear . 
 
The following question is therefore referred to the CJEU: “ Does Directive 97/81, and in particular 
clause 4 of the Framework Agreement annexed thereto concerning the principle of non -
discrimination, require that periods of serv ice prior to the deadline for transposing the Directive 
should be taken into account when calculating the amount of the retirement pension of a part -time 
worker, if they would be taken into account when calculating the pension of a comparable full -time 
worker?”

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses RFC’s appeal . Lord Hodge  gives the judgment, with which 
the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Three aspects of statutory interpretation are important in determining thi s appeal. First, provisions in 
the tax code imposing specific tax charges do not militate against the existence of a more general 
charge to tax which may have priority over or qualify the specific charge. Secondly, it is necessary to 
pay close attention to  the statutory wording and not be distracted by judicial glosses which have 
enabled the court to apply the statutory words in other factual contexts. Thirdly, a purposive approach 
to the interpretation of the taxing provisions  must be adopted  [15]. 
 
As a g eneral rule, the charge to tax on income extends to money  that the employee is entitled to have  
paid as remuneration  irrespective of  whether it is paid to the employee or to a third party  [41]. The 
relevant ICTA and ITEPA provisions do not restrict the con cept of earnings  by requiring payment to 
a specific recipient [38]. Section 62(2)(b) ITEPA confines the charge on perquisites and profits  to 
benefits received by the employee, but there is no such restriction in section 62(2)(a) or 62(2)(c) [49]. 
Nothing  in the wider purpose of the legislation excludes from the tax charge remuneration which the 
employee is entitled to have paid to a third party [39]. Parliament has sought to tax remuneration paid 
in money or money’ s worth. There is n o rationale for excludin g from the scope of this tax charge 
remuneration in the form of money which the employee agrees should be paid to a third party [59].  
 
For the purposes  of PAYE  it is necessary to determine whether there has been a payment of earnings 
from which deductions  were required. Misplaced reliance on judicial glosse s in relation to the concept 
of “payment”  is evident in the case law leading up  to the appeal  [51]. There is no basis for establishing 
a general rule that a payment is made for the purposes of PAYE only if the money is paid to or at least 
placed unreservedly at the disposal of the employee [54]. The references to making a relevant payment 
“to an employee” or “other payee” in the PAYE Regulations fall to be construed as payment either to 
the employee or to  the person to whom payment is made with the agreement of the employee [58]. 
 
The sums paid to the trustee of the Principal Trust for a footballer constituted the footballer’s earnings 
[64]. The risk that the trustee might not set up a sub -trust or give a loan of the sub -trust funds to the 
footballer does not alter the nature of the payments made to the trustee of the Principal Trust [65]. 
The discretionary bonuses made available to RFC’s employees through the same trust mechanisms also 
fall within the tax charge as these were given in respect of the employee’s work [66]. Payment to the 
Principal Trust should have been subject to deduction of income tax under the PAYE Regulations 
[67]. As the sums paid into the Principal Trust were earnings  in the first plac e, the specific provisions 
of the tax code which deem the benefit of loans to be earnings cannot apply [69].

The Supreme Court  unanimously rejects the respondent ’s challenge to the competency of the appeal

Appeal Court to deal with the responde nt’s appeal against the extradition order of the Scottish The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom

 Ministers  and his devolution minute in that appeal. Lord Hodge  gives the judgment, with which the 
other Justices agree.   
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The competency of the appeal  to the Supreme Court  
 
The challenge to the competency of the appeal is misconceived [14]. An appeal from the sheriff’s 
decision under section 87(1) of the 2003 Act as to whether extradition would be compatible with the 
respondent’s Convention rights raises a question of the le gal competence of the Scottish Government 
[15]. Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998 paragraph 1(d) includes within the definition of a 
“devolution issue” “a question whether a […] proposed exercise of a function of the Scottish 
Executive […] would be, inco mpatible with any of the Convention rights ” [18]. Therefore, t he 
question whether the Scottish Government’s acts in seeking to extradite the respondent are compatible 
with Convention rights is a devolution issue  which was determined by  the Appeal Court  [19, 22]. 
Neither party to the appeal intimated the devolution issue to the Advocate General for Scotland thus 
depriving him  of his right to take part in the Appeal Court proceedings. That omission, however, does 
not affect the competence of any appeal of the  determination of the devolution issue to this court [21]. 
 
The correct legal test  
 
The Appeal Court, in assessing the compatibility of the extradition with article 3 ECHR, applied the 
wrong legal test [9]. The correct legal test when the threat comes from  the acts of third parties  is 
whether the state has failed to provide reasonable protection against harm inflicted by non -state 
agents. The Appeal Court did not address that test and no clear distinction was drawn between the 
threat from other prisoners, a nd the conduct for which the state was responsible. The court must 
asses s, firs t, whether the Taiwanese authorities are undertaking to provide the respondent with 
reasonable protection against violence by third parties while in prison, and, secondly, if th ey are, 
whether the conditions in which he is to have such protection would infringe  article 3  [24]. 
 
There is no evidence that the Taiwanese authorities will not give the respondent reasonable protection 
against harm at the hands of other prisoners: the u ndertakings would allow him to elect to remain in 
his cell and exercise outdoors alone  [39]. As to whether the confinement which such a regime would 
entail would risk a breach of article 3, the relative isolation which the respondent may elect for his own 
protection  does not come close to a breach of article 3. Further, the other factors which influenced the 
majority of the Appeal Court, including the ratio of medical staff to prisoners and the monitoring of 
the assurances by UK consular staff, do not outwe igh the other factors which point towards accepting 
the assurances  [40-47]. The assurances offer the respondent reasonable protection against violence by 
non-state actors and the circumstances of his confinement, should he be unable to mix with the wider 
prison population, do not entail a real risk of his being subject to treatment that infringes article 3 [48]. 
 
Article 5 and Article 8  
 
The article 5 and article 8  challenges are without substance [49]. There is nothing arbitrary for the 
purposes of article  5 in the respondent serving two -thirds of the remainder of his sentence in Taiwan 
before he would be eligible for parole. The respondent’s inability to obtain credit toward parole in 
Taiwan for the time spent in custody in Scotland is the result of his fl ight from justice in Taiwan. This 
involves no injustice [50]. The interference with the respondent’s article 8 right to private life which 
arises from his extradition and imprisonment in Taiwan is justified because it is necessary for both the 
prevention o f crime and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others [51].

 The Supreme Court allows  the owners ’ appeal .  The charterers are not entitled to a credit for t he 
difference in the value of the vessel when sold in 2007, in comparison to its diminished value in 2009 .  
Lord Clarke, with whom the other justices agree, gives the lead judgment.   REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 The fall in the value of the vessel is irrelev ant because the owners’ interest in the capital value of the 
vessel had nothing to do with the interest injured by the charterers’ repudiation of the charterparty [29] . 
This is not because the benefit must be the same ki nd as the  loss caused by the wrongdoer,  but because 
the benefit was not caused either by the breach of the charterparty or by a successful act of mitigation [30]. The repudiation resulted in a prospective loss of income for a period of about two years. However, 
there was nothing about the pr emature termination of the charterparty which made it necessary to sell 
the vessel, at all or at any particular time. It could also have been sold during the term of the charter party. 
When to sell the vessel wa s a commercial decision made at the owners’ ow n risk [32]. The owners  would 
not have been able to claim the difference in the market value of the vessel i f the market value had risen 
between the sale in 2007 and the time the charterparty would have terminated in 2009. The premature 
termination of the charterparty was at most the occasion f or selling the vessel, but it was  not the legal 
cause of it. There is equally no reason to assume that the relevant comparator is a sale in November 2009; there is no reason that a sale would necessarily have followed  the lawf ul redelivery at the end of 
the charterparty term [33] .  
 For the same reasons,  the sale of the ship was not on the face of it an act of successful mitigation. If 
there had been an available charter market, the loss would have been the difference bet ween the actual 
charterparty rate and the assumed substitute contract rate. Sale of the vessel would have been irrelevant. In the absence of an available market, the measure of the loss is the difference between the contract rate and what was or ought r easonably to have been earned from employment of the vessel under shorter 
charterparties. The relevant mitigation in that context is the acquisition of an alternative income stream to the income stream under the original charterparty. The sale of the vesse l was not itself an act of 
mitigation because it was incapable of mitigating the loss of the income stream [34] .  
 Popplewell J was therefore correct to hold that the arbitrator erred in principle. The Supreme Court prefers his conclusion to that of the Court  of Appeal’s. His order, setting aside the part of the arbitral 
award that declared that the charterers were entitled to a credit of €11,251,677 in respect of the benefit that accrued to the owners when they sold the vessel in October 2007 as opposed to  November 2009, 
is therefore  restored  [36] .

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The fundamental objective of section 94B arises from the fact that the appellants are “foreign criminals ” and, by 
virtue of section 32(4) of the UK Borders Act 2007, the deportation of a “foreign criminal” is conducive to the public 
good [32-33]. However, Parliament gave foreign criminals a right of appeal against a deportation order by enacting 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 section 82(1) and (3A) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The public interest in the removal of 
an appellant in advance of his appeal is outweighed by the public interest that a right of appeal should be effective 
[35]. 
 
In proceedings for judicial review of a section 94B  certificate , the tribunal must decide for itself whether deportation 
in advance of appeal would breach the appellant’s  ECHR  rights. It must assess for itself the proportionality of 
deportation at that stage , albeit attaching considerable weight to public policy considerations relied on by the  
respondent [42-43]. The application of the Wednesbury  criterion to the right to depart from the Home Office’s findings 
of fact, even when height ened to “anxious scrutiny”, is inapt. Under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, the 
court may require to be more proactive than application of that crite rion would permit. The residual pow er of the 
court to determine facts, and to receive evidence including oral evidence, needs to be recognised [47]. 
 
Article 8 requires that an appeal against a deportation order by reference to a claim in respect of private and family 
life should be effective [51-52]. While the effect of an appellant’s immediate removal from the UK is likely to 
significantly weaken his arguable a ppeal [58], what is determinative  of these appeals  is whether the issue of a section 
94B certificate obstructs  an appellant’s ability to effectively present his appeal against the deportation order [59]. In 
an appeal brought from abroad, the appellant’s ab ility to present his case is likely to be obstructed in a number of 
ways.  Even  if he is able to secure legal representation, the appellant  and his lawyer would face formidable difficulties 
in giving and receiving instructions prior to and during the hearing [60]. Further, the effectiveness  of an arguable  
appeal is likely to  turn on the ability of the appellant to give live evidence  to assist  the tribunal in its assessment of 
whether he is a reformed character and the quality of his relationships with others in the UK , in particular with any 
child, partner or other family member [61, 63]. 
 
An effective appeal requires that  the appellants are afforded the opportunity to give live evidence  [76]. While the 
giving of evidence on screen is not optimum, it might be enough to render the appeal effective for the purposes of 
article 8, provided that the opportunity to give  evidence in that way is realistically available to them [67]. However, 
the financial and logistical barriers to the ir giving evidence on screen from abroad are almost insurmountable.   
 
The respondent has therefore certified article 8 claims of foreign criminals under section 94B in the absence of a 
ECHR -compliant system for the conduc t of an appeal from abroad. The  Ministry of Justice has failed to make 
provision for facilities at the hearing centre, or for  access to such facilities abroad, as would allow the appellant s to 
give live evidence  and participate in the  hearing  [76]. Deportation pursuant to the certificates would  therefore  
interfere with the appellants’ rights to respect for the ir private and family life in the UK pursuant to article 8 and, in 
particular, with the aspect of  their rights which requires that their challenge to a threatened breach of them should be 
effective. The respondent has failed to establish that deportation in advance of appeal strikes a fair balance between 
the rights of the appellants and the interests  of the community  and t herefore the decisions to issue the certificates 
were unlawful  [78]. 
 
In a concurring judgment, Lord Carnwath  concludes that  an effective appeal for the purposes of article 8 is unlikely 
to turn on subjective issues  requiring the appellant to give direct evidence , such as whether the appellant is a reformed 
character [100] . However, it is wrong in principle for the respondent, as the opposing party to the appeal, to be 
allowed  to dictate the conduct of the appellant’s case or the e vidence on which he chooses to rely . The respondent 
must be able, at the time of certification, to satisfy herself that the necessary facilities can and will be provided [102] .

The Supreme Court by a majority of 3 to 2 dismiss es the appeal.  Lord Wilson gives the lead  majority 
judgment, with which Lord Reed and Lord Hughes agree. Lord Reed gives a concurring judgment, 
with which Lord Hughes agrees.  Lady Hale and Lord Kerr give d issenting judgments.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Wilson  expresses sympathy with the deeply unenviable position of those in the situation of the 
appellant, but  rejects the public law challenge . Parliament’s scheme is that separate authorities in each 
of the four countries in the United Kingdom  should provide free health services to those usually 
resident there. The respondent was entitled to make a decision in line with this scheme for local 
decision -making. Further, the respondent was entitled to afford  respect to the democratic decision of 
the people of Northern Ireland not to fund abortion services , and to take into account the ability of 
Northern Irish women to lawfully travel to England and purchase private abortion services there [20].  
 
Lord Wilson  concludes that the human rights challenge fails as the difference in treatment was justified 
[35]. The respondent’s decision as to whether to provide abortion services to a group of women free 
of charge falls within the scope of article 8 [22]. The respon dent treated women usually resident in 
England differently from women who, although UK citizens, were usually resident in Northern Ireland 
[31]. A d ifference of treatment  between UK citizens present in England on the grounds of usual 
residence falls within  the scope of “other status” for the purposes of article 14 [27]. The  respondent’s 
aim to stay loyal to the devolved scheme for health services  and the democratic decision reached in 
Northern Ireland in relation to abortion services was rationally connecte d to his decision not to make 
the direction sought by the appellants. With that aim in mind he could not have reached any decision 
less intrusive upon the article 8 rights of the appellants  [32]. The respondent’s decision struck  a fair 
balance between the appellants’ rights and the interests  of the UK community  as a whole  and, 
accordingly, was justified . As such, the difference in treatment did not amount to discrimination  [35].  
 
In a concurring judgment, Lord Reed reviews  decisions and judgments of the Eu ropean Court of 
Human Rights and the former  European  Commission  on Human Rights  that relate  to devolved laws 
which differentiat e between UK citizens according to whether they are residents of that part of the UK  
[38-48]. Such  differential treatment falls w ithin the scope of article 14 and requires to be justified [49]. 
 
Lord Kerr  would have allow ed the appeal. While the  aim in s ection 1 (1)(a)  of the 2006 Act relating to  
the improvement of physical and mental health is limited to the people of England, the a im in section 
1(1)(b) relating to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness is not so limited  [59]. Northern 
Irish w omen who seek an abortion in England are being treated “for the prevention…of illness”  under 
section  1(1)(b) as allowing an unwante d pregnancy to continue to term carries a risk of physical or 
mental injury  [69]. In failing to exercise his power , the respondent was wrong to believe that his 
section 3 duties  were confined to the people of England [72] and that affording respect to the 
Northern Ireland  Assembly required  denying Northern Irish women the means of obtaining abortions 
in England. The Northern Ireland  Assembly has expressed no view about the ability of Northern Irish 
women to travel to England to obtain abortions [74]. Allowi ng these  abortions to take place on the 
NHS would not alter the democratic decision of the  Northern Ireland  Assembly [75]. In respect of the 
human rights challenge, Lord Kerr would have held that no  legitimate aim exists for  the interference 
with article 8  [87]. Allowing Northern Irish women abortions on the NHS would not compromise the 
scheme of local provision of medical services [84-85]. Further, neither democratic deference to the 
Northern Ireland Assembly nor cost can qualify as legitimate aims [86].  
 
Lady Hale agrees with Lord Kerr [92]. Further, i f the requirements of the Abortion Act 1967 are 
complied with then it is a reasonable requirement under section 3 of the 2006 Act that the respondent  
provide a woman  with a service, wherever she comes from. The NHS can charge women from abroad 
in respect of  abortion services. But they cannot charge women from the United Kingdom [94].

 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
APs are commissioned rather than d irectly provided by the Secretary of State. However, under s 29(6)  
EA, a person exercising a public function such as this must not ‘do anything that constitutes 
discrimination, harassment or victimisation’. I t is not necessary for the appellant to show tha t every 
female prisoner required to live at an AP  has suffered the detriment of being placed at an AP far from 
her home in order to establish a  case of direct discrimination  on grounds of sex [29-31]. Nor a re there 
differences between the circumstances of male and female prisoners required to live in APs, which are 
material  to the issue  of accommodating them close to home. In this respect the ir circumstances  are 
comparable, and the risk of being placed far from home i s much greater for women than for men [32]. 
The reason for this is not any deliberate desire to treat the women less favourably than the men but a 
function of the much smaller numbers of female offenders and the policy decision that the particular 
vulnerability of women  required to live in an AP  means  that all APs should be single sex [33]. The 
appellant’s case is one of direct rather than indirect discrimination [43].  
 
Direct discrimination can  only be justified in certain limited and defined circumstances, including those 
set out in paragraph 2 6 of Schedule 3 to the EA. Paragraph 26(2) relates to the provision of separate 
and different services for men and women, and provides that these  will not contravene s 29 if (a) a 
joint service for persons of both sexes would be less effective , (b) it is n ot reasonably practicable to 
provide a service which is not different, and (c) the limited provision is a proportionate means  of 
achieving a legitimate aim [24, 34].  
 
There is no dispute that in relation to APs, providing a joint service would be less effe ctive. The 
appellant also accepts that the much lesser extent to which women require APs makes it ‘not 
reasonably practicable’ to provide the same number of APs for each sex  [38]. The crucial question is 
whether the limited provision for women is a proport ionate means of achieving a legitimate aim  [39]. 
Saving cost is a legitimate objective of public policy but if a benefit is to be limited to save costs it must 
be limited in a non -discriminatory way [40]. The appella nt accepts that in principle the differe nt 
provision for men and women might be justified but the Ministry of Justice has never properly 
addressed its mind to the problem of providing sufficient and suitable places in APs for women which 
achieve, so far as is practicable, the policy of placing t hem as close to home as possible. There are 
other options which could have been considered , such as replacing large women’s APs with smaller 
units more widely spread, or replacing one or more of the existing women’s APs with APs closer to 
the areas where m any women offenders have their homes, or considering alternative forms of 
accommodation for women released on licence  [41]. It is for the Secretary of State to show that the 
discrimination is justified and, in the light of the breach of the PSED , she has s o far failed to do this  
[42].  
 
The Supreme Court therefore allows the appeal to the extent that it makes a declaration that the 
provision of APs in England and Wales constitutes direct discrimination against women contrary to s 
13(1) EA, which is unlawful  unless justified under paragraph 26 of Schedule 3 to the EA. No such 
justification has yet been shown by the Secretary of State. Individual women who are less favourably 
treated as a result of the provision of APs may bring sex discrimination claims in th e county court but 
it will be open to the Secretary of State to resist such  claim s on the ground that the provision is 
justified under paragraph 26 [45].

The Supreme Court allows  the teachers’ appeal . Lord Clarke, wit h whom the other justices agr ee, gives 
the lead judgment.  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
The Act is intended to address the problems which arise in the context of periodic payments which are 
entire indivisible payments. The appellants’ salaries are such payme nts; the contracts do not provide 
expressly or by necessary implication for their sa laries to paid to staff pro rata in  respect of divisible 
obligations to perform work on each day of directed time. The Act is therefore applicable to their 
contracts [9-11].  
The use of the word “considered” in section 2 of the Act shows that the section is a deemi ng 
provision, which deems that payments are to accrue day by day at an equal rate. Where an employment 
contract is an annual contract, it must therefore be apport ioned on a daily basis over 365 days, yielding 
a daily figure of 1/365 [24, 30, 34, 37] . If the employment contract was other than an annual contract, 
then the rate would no doubt be different [48]. 
Section 7 of the Act provides that the Act will not appl y where it is “expressly stipulated that no 
apportionment shall take place” [4]. This means that the principle of equal daily apportionment will 
apply unless the contract in clear terms addresses it and says it should not. W here the language of the 
contrac t is clearly inconsistent with this principle  this will also amount to an express stipulation for the 
purposes of section 7  [38-40]. There is nothing in the appellants’ contracts which stipulates for any 
apportionment other than apportionment on a calendar  day basis. The Court of Appeal’s approach 
assumes that working days are limited to days on which directed duties are carried out [28-29]. 
However, t he appellants are paid a salary to perform the duties referred to in their contracts and there 
is no sugges tion that some of those are paid and some unpaid. Given the wide scope of the 
responsibilities of teachers, none of the appellants are able to carry out all of their work during direct ed 
time, therefore the appellants carry out much of their work in undire cted time outside of the normal 
college day on evenings, weekends and days of annual leave.  While there is a relationship between 
directed work and undirected work, much undirected work is important in its own right and will not  
necessarily be directly lin ked to the directed time in the sense that a failure to work for the day will lead 
to a proportionate reduction in the  undirected work done . This is clear from the vast variety of 
“Professional Duties” identified in the Red Book under the heading of “Other  Activities” and not 
“Teaching”  [18-20, 44 -46].  
Therefore, in the appellants’ case, section 2 of the Act deems that their salaries accrue at an equal daily 
rate and this  is not excluded by section 7. The respondent was therefore only entitled to make 
deductions from the appellants ’ pay at a rate of 1/365 of their annual salary [47-49].

Lord Neuberger writes the lead judgment, with whom  (i) Lord Kerr and Lord Reed agree , (ii) save on 
an obiter issue  on Issue 2 , Lord Sumption  agrees , and (iii) save  on Issue 2  on which he dissents,  Lord 
Clarke agrees .  
 
CONCLUSIONS AND REASONS  
 
Issue 1 : LBHI2’s contention , which turns on the interpretation of the Subordinated Loan Agreements, 
is that its claim as subordinated creditor ranks ahead of  statutory interest and  non-provable liabilitie s 
because they  are “obligations… not payable… in the insolvency”  of LBIE or  (in the case of statutory 
interest) it is  not “payable and owing by [LBIE]”  within the meaning  of the Subordinated Loan 
Agreements . In agreement with the courts below, t he Supreme  Court rejects LBHI2’s argument s. 
Statutory interest  is plainly an obligation pay able in LBIE’s insolvency  [48-49]. It is  also “payable and 
owing by [LBIE ]”, even though LBIE could not be sued for it  [51-56]. Secondly,  the notion that  a 
liquidator who meets a non -provable liability make s a payment “in the Insolvency”  is implied by the 
provisions of the 1986 Act and by the practical realit ies [58-61], and the same applies to an administrator 
[62]. Accordingly , statutory interest and non -provable liabilities must be met before any balance can be 
used for payment of the subordinated loans  [64]. In agreement with the judge and disagreeing with the 
Court of Appeal, LBHI2 cannot  prove for the subordinated loans  until the non -provable liabilities a re 
paid or clearly could be met [70].  
 
Issue 2 : Disagreeing with the Ju dge and the majority of th e Court o f Appeal, the Supreme Court 
conclude s by a majority  of 4 to 1  that rule 2.86 , which provides that unsecured debts payable in foreign 
currencies are to be converted in to sterling at the official rate on the administration date,  spells out the 
full extent of a foreign currency creditor’s rights [90], and so foreign currency creditors cannot claim as 
a non -provable debt the difference between the sterling value of the debt at the administration date and 
that at the date the debt was paid [112] . This is consistent with the conclusion reached  in reports 
produced prior to the 1986 legislation [88]. It is also supported by the fact that the  contrary conclusion  
would lead to a one -way option in favour  of the foreign currency creditors  [91] and that, in contrast to 
proofs for certain other  debts, there is no provision in the 1986 Rules for their adjustment [93]. It is 
dangerous to rely on judicial dicta  regarding a previous insolvency code [83]. Lord Clarke dissents on 
this issue  [206 and 21 1-221].

 Parliament Squa re London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 On the wider issue whether the payment in full of a proved debt satisfies the underlying contractual 
debt, by a majority of 3 to 2  the Supreme Court inclines to the view  that it is inconsistent with Chapter 
10 of Part 2 of the 1986 Rules , and the  natural meaning of rule 2.72(1) , that a debt met in full  nonetheless 
has a component which is capable of resurrection [104-107]. Lord Sumption is inclined to disagree  on 
this issue  [195-201] and Lord Clarke agrees with him . 
 
Issue 3 : Rule 2.88(7) only app lies to an existing administration and constitutes a direction to an 
administrator while in office. Section 189(2) and rule 4.93 exclude  rule 2.88(7) interest being proved for 
or paid once a company previously in administration is put in to liquidation [117]. In agreement with the 
Judge and disagreeing with the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court considers that it is impermissible to 
have recourse to an entirely new judge -made rule to fill this gap [120-123]. Disagreeing with the Judge, 
the Supreme Court con cludes that t he contractual right to interest for the post -administration period 
does not revive or survive in favour of a creditor who has proved for a debt and been paid on his proof 
in a distributing administration. R ules 2.88, 4.93 and section 189 prov ide a complete statutory code for 
recovery of interest on proved debts [124-5].  
 
Issue 4 : “Liabilities” in section 74  of the 1986 Act  is not limited to those capable of being the  subject -
matter of a proof  and includes non -provable liabilities [136] . However, rule 2.88(7) provides that  
statutory interest is payable  only where there is a surplus  after payment of the debts proved, and , in 
disagreement with the  Judge and the  Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court holds that  section 74 cannot 
be invoked to c reate a “surplus” from which statutory interest can then be paid  [139] .  
 
Issue 5: section 150 create s a statutory obligation on a member [153]  and entitles  the liquidator to make 
the call to fulfil his statutory duties . Contrary to the view of the courts below, the Supreme Court 
considers that the nature of that obligation  is such that it is incapable of being the subject matter of a 
proof unless the company concerned is in liquidation [154] . Any money paid under section 74 forms a 
statutory fund which can  only come into existence once th at company is in liquidation [156] ; if that  
company not in liquidation, there  is no existing person to be identified as a potential creditor, merely a 
possible future liquidator [158] . Further, t he alternative would lead to serious difficulties [160-163].  
 
Issue 6 : essentially for the same reasons , prospective section 150 liabilities cannot be set off by the LBIE 
administrators [171] .  
 
Issue 7 : It is plainly inconsistent with the pari passu  principle and with the statutory aim of enabling 
effective calls to be made in a liquidation to allow LBHI2 and LBL to be paid out on their proofs like 
any other unsecured creditor, given that they are probably insolvent [172] . The contributory rule which  
applies in liquidations can properly be,  and should  be, extended to a  distributing  administration, with 
procedural modifications to achieve consistency with the legislative framework  [180-182].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Secretary of State’s power  to issue national policy guidance such as th e NPPF derives, expressly or 
by implication, from the planning Acts which give him overall responsibility for oversight of the The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 planning system.  This is reflected both in specific requirements and more generally in his power to 
intervene in many aspects of  the planning process [19-20].  The policy -making role should not, 
however, be overstated: the NPPF  itself makes clear that in respect of the determination of planning 
applications (by contrast with plan -making) it is not more than “guidance” for the purpo ses of section 
70(2) of the 1990 Act .  It does not  displace the primacy of the statutory development plan  [21]. 
 
The correct approach to the interpretation of a statutory development plan was discussed by the 
Supreme Court in Tesco Stores Ltd v Dundee City  Council [2012] UKSC 13 [23].  It is important that the 
role of the court is not overstated: in Tesco Stores  Lord Reed identified the interpretation of the word 
“suitable” a s the short point to determine, and  further recognised that some policies in the 
development plan may be expressed in broader terms and not require the same level of legal analysis 
[24].  These are statements of policy – whether in a development plan or in a non -statutory statement 
such as the NPPF – and must be read in that light; they are not statutory texts  [74].  Lord Gill adds 
that the NPPF expresses general principles applied by more specific prescriptions.  These must always 
be interpreted in the overall context of the guidance document [75].   Furthermore, the courts should 
respec t the expertise of the specialist planning inspectors, and start at least from the presumption that 
they will have understood the policy framework correctly .  Their position is in some ways analogous to 
that of expert tribunals, in respect of which the cou rts have cautioned against undue intervention by 
the courts in policy judgments within their areas of specialist competence  [25]. 
 
Recourse to the courts may sometimes be needed to resolve distinct issues of law, or to ensure 
consistency of interpretation in relation to specific policies.  However, it is important to distinguish 
clearly between issues of interpretation of policy, appropriate for judicial analysis, and issues of 
judgement in the application of that policy [26].  Lord Gill describes the prope r role of the courts as 
interpreting a policy  or the NPPF  where its meaning is contested, while that of the planning authority 
is to apply the policy or guidance  to the facts of the individual case [72, 73]. 
 
The primary purpose of paragraph 49 of the NPPF  is simply to act as a trigger to the operation of the 
“tilted balance” under paragraph 14 [54].  Paragraph 14 – unlike paragraph 49 – is not concerned 
solely with housing policy and needs to work for other forms of development covered by the 
development p lan.  For example, whether a relevant policy for the sup ply of employment land 
becomes out -of-date is a matter o f planning judgment [55].  Housing policies deemed out -of-date 
under paragraph 49 must also be read in that light – and it is not necessary to l abel other policies as 
out-of-date merely in order to determine the weight to be given to them under paragraph 14 [56]. 
 
Paragraph 49 appears in a group of paragraphs dealing with the delivery of housing, with paragraph 47 
providing the objective of boosti ng the housing supply  [76, 80] .  In that context the words “policies 
for the supply of housing” indicate the category of policies with which we are concerned: the word 
“for” simply indicates the purpose of the policies in question.  There is no justificati on for substituting 
the word “affecting” which has a different emphasis [57, 82].  Although this can be regarded as 
adopting the ‘narrow’ meaning, it should not be seen as leading to the need for a legalistic exercise to 
decide whether individual policies do or do not come within the expression.  The important question is 
not how to define the individual policies, but whether the result is a five -year supply in accordance 
with the objectives set by paragraph 47 [59].   
 
On both appeals the Supreme Court reaches the same result  as the Court of Appeal  [62, 86]: in 
Richborough Estates  the inspector erred in treating policy NE.2 as a “policy for the supply of housing” 
under paragraph 49, but that did not detract materially from the force of his reasoning [63].  In Suffolk 
Coastal  the inspector’s approach was open to criticism because his categorisation of SP 19 and SP 27 
was inappropriate and unnecessary, rather than erroneous as the Court of Appeal held.  It nevertheless 
gave rise to an error of law insofar as i t may have distorted his approach to paragraph 14 [65, 68].

The Supreme Court  unanimously dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of  the review -officer.  
Lord Carnwath gives the judgment, with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Two issues arise on this appeal: (1) whether the Supreme Court should depart from the its own  decision in 
Ali v Birmingham City Council [2010] 2 AC 39 in light of the European Court of Human Rights’ (ECtHR) 
judgment in Ali v United Kingdom (2016) 63 EHRR 20 , and if so to what extent; and (2) whether the 
reviewing officer should have asked himself whether there was a real risk that the appe llant’s mental health 
would be damaged by moving into the accommodation offered, whether or not her reaction to it was 
irrational, and if so, whether he did in fact apply the right test [3]. 
 The Su preme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Ali v Birmingham City Council  
 
In Ali v Birmingham City Council  the Supreme Court  decided that the duties imposed on housing authorities 
under Part VII  of the Housing Act 1996 did not give rise to “civil” rights or obligations and so Article 6 of 
the European Convention on Human Rights did not apply to it.  In Ali v Un ited Kingdom  the ECtHR held 
that Article 6.1 did apply, but accepted that in any event the procedure applied under the Housing Act 
conformed to its requirements [18]. 
 
The review  of the domestic authorities shows a continuing debate on this issue, against the backdrop of 
uncertain Strasbourg jurisprudence.   The unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court in Ali v Birmingham 
City Council  was intended to settle the issue at domestic level after a full review of the Strasbourg 
authorities [32].  The Chamber in Ali v United Kingdom acknowledged the weight to be given to the 
interpretation of the relevant provisions by the domestic courts and it is thus surprising  that it failed to 
address in any detail either the Supreme Court’s reasoning or its concerns over “judic ialisation” of the 
welfare services.  The Chamber instead focused on two obiter remarks by Hale LJ (as she then was) and 
Lord Millett; its treatment of these two statements is open to the criticism that they were taken out of 
context [33, 34] .  Further que stions can also be raised about the Chamber’s reliance on the decision in 
Schuler -Zgraggen v Switzerland  as an example of entitlement subject to “discretion”: the statute in question 
gave a right to a full invalidity pension where incapacity of at least 66 .66% was established.  It is hard to 
see any fair compa rison with the range of factors  to which authorities are entitled to have regard in 
fulfilling their obligations under the housing legislation [35]. 
 
The Court’s duty under the Human Rights Act 1998 is  “to have regard” to the decision of the Strasbourg 
court Section.  There appears to be no relevant Grand Chamber decision on the issue, but the Supreme 
Court would normally follow a “clear and constant line” of chamber decisions.  In Ali v United Kingdom  it is 
apparent from the Chamber’s reasoning that it was consciously going beyond the scope of previous cases 
and its answer to Lord Hope’s concern that there was “no clearly defined stopping point” to the process 
of expansion seems to have been that none w as needed.  That is a possible view, but one which should not 
readily be adopted without full consideration of its practical implications for the working of the domestic 
regime [36].  This is a case in which the Supreme Court should not regard the Chamber’ s decision as a 
sufficient reason to depart from its own fully considered and unanimous conclusion in Ali v Birmingham 
City Council .  It is appropriate to await a full consideration by the  Grand Chamber before considering  
whether (and if so how) to modify the domestic position [37]. 
 
The reviewing officer’s approach  
 
The appeal on this issue well illustrates the relevance of the warning against over -zealous linguistic 
analysis.  This is not to diminish the importance of the responsibility given to housing a uthorities under 
the 1996 Act (and reinforced in the case of disability by the Equality Act 2010).  The decision -letter viewed 
as a whole reads a s a conscientious attempt by a hard -pressed housing officer to cover every conceivable 
issue raised in the case : he clearly understood the importance of considering her mental state against the 
background of her imprisonment in Iran [39]. 
 
Although the officer did not in terms address the appellant’s claim to have suffered a panic attack, it is 
hard to criticise hi m for giving little weight to an incident which she had not mentioned at the time, nor 
apparently to her medical advisers.  The issue for him was not her immediate reaction on one short visit, 
but show she would reasonably have been expected to cope with l iving there in the longer term.  On that 
he was entitled to give weight to the medical evidence submitted by her, and consider how far it supported 
her case [40].  It might well have been unreasonable to offer her “accommodation with very small dark 
rooms without windows at a normal height and looking out onto everyday life”, but that was not a 
reasonable description of this particular property, nor a sufficient ground for her not accepting it.  There is 
no difficulty in understanding the officer’s reasonin g overall, nor does it disclose  any error of law [41].

The Supreme Court  unanimously  dismisses  the appeal  on the ground that there was no  breach of the  
safe port undertaking . Lord Clarke gives the lead judgment, with which all the justices agree on issue 1 
and on issue 3; if there had been a breach of the safe port undertaking Daiichi would not have been 
entitled to limit its liability under t he Convention . In respect of  issue 2 , Lord Toulson  and Lord Mance , 
in judgments with which Lord Hodge concurs, agree with the Court of Appeal , that the joint insurance 
would have precluded any claim by owners against the demise charterer, or therefore by t he latter 
down the line.  Lord Clarke and Lord Sumption take the opposite view.   
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
It was common ground that the test for breach of the safe port undertaking is whether  the damage 
sustained by the vessel was caused by an “abnormal o ccurrence” [10], that the date for judging the 
breach of the safe port promise is the date of nomination of the port and the promise is a prediction 
about the safety of the port when the ship arrives in the future. [13, 24]. ‘Abnormal occurrence’ should 
be given its ordinary meaning; something rare and unexpected that  the notional charterer would not 
have in mind  [16, 25 , 27]. The test is not whether the events which caused the loss are reasonably 
foreseeable. The fact that the combination of long waves and  northerly gales was theoretically 
foreseeable does not make it a “normal characteristic” of the port. Regard must  be had to the reality of 
the situation in the context of all the evidence to ascertain whether the particular event was sufficiently 
likely t o occur to have become an attribute of the port [14, 32, 37 -40]. Teare J erred in failing to 
answer the unitary question of whether the simultaneous coincidence of the long waves and gales was 
an abnormal occurrence [34]. No vessel in the port’s history ha d risked damage in the quay due to 
long waves at the same time the Kashima Fairway was unnavigable because  of gale force winds. There 
was also evidence regarding the exceptional nature of the rapid development, duration and severity  of 
the storm . On the ba sis of this evidence the conditions in question were an abnormal occurrence and 
there was therefore no breach  by D aiichi of the safe port undertaking [41-45].  
Assuming  there had been a breach of the safe port warranty, Gard claims to be able to recover t he 
insured value  of the vessel  from the time charterers as the demise charterer ’s assignee  on the basis that 
the demise charterer is liable to the owners for breach of its  safe port undertaking , and is therefore 
entitled to recover the same sum from the ti me charterer [93, 138]. Lord Toulson, Lord Mance and 
Lord Hodge  conclude that the provisions of clause 12  of the demise charter , which provide  for joint 
insurance and a distribution of insur ance proceeds , preclude  such a claim . It is well established that co-
insured s cannot claim against each other in respect of an insured loss. Clause 12 provides a  
comprehensive scheme for an insurance funded result in the event of loss of the vessel by marine risk s. 
The safe port undertaking does  not alter this scheme. [139-146, 114 -122]. Lord Sumption agrees that 
co-insureds cannot claim  against each other  in respect of an insured loss . Whether this is because 
liability to pay damages is excluded by the terms of the contract, or because as between the co -insureds 
the insu rer’s payment makes good any loss and satisfies any liability to pay damages will depend on the 
terms of the contract [99-100]. In this case clause 12 of the demise  charter  envisages the latter [101-
105]. Lord Clarke agrees with Lord Sumption  on this issue  [48-57].  
Had there been a breach of the safe port warranty, Daiichi would not have been entitled to limit its 
liability under the Convention . Article 2(1)(a) of the Convention allows owners or charter ers to limit 
liability for loss or damage to property “occurring on board the ship” or “in direct connexion with the 
operation of the ship” [61]. The court agrees with the Court of Appeal in The CMA Djakarta  that 
giving the words their ordinary meaning, this category of claim does not include loss or damage to the 
ship itself [79-81]. This interpretation is supported by Articles 9 to 11 of the Convention [82-84] and 
there is nothing in the travaux préparatoires which supports another conclusion [86].

 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Issue (i) – The “sufficiently serious” condition in EU law  
ATK’s case in the Supreme Court was that EU law requires a remedy in damages for a ny breach, 
whether serious or not, or that this issue should at least be referred to the Court of Justice. This case 
would, if accepted, have constituted a reason for reaching the same result as the Court of Appeal did 
by reference to domestic law. ATK’s c ase is not, however, accepted on this issue. The decision of the 
Court of Justice in Spijker (Case C -568/98) provides clear authority that the liability of a contracting 
authority under the Remedies Directive for breach of the PP Directive is assimilated t o that of the 
state or of a public body for which the state is responsible  [19-25]. Such liability is only required to 
exist where the minimum “Francovich” conditions are met, the second of which is that the breach must 
be sufficiently serious  [9]. Article s 1 to 3 of the Remedies Directive do not evince an intention to 
provide a remedy in damages for harm caused by infringements generally [14; 25]. Any further 
international obligation (if any) to which the EU may have committed itself under the Government 
Procurement Agreement (“GPA 1994”), including under  article XX(7), provide s only weak support for 
ATK’s argument to the contrary and cannot in any event withstan d the clear impact of the Court’s 
judgment in Spijker  [15; 25] .  
 
Issue (ii) – The second Franco vich condition at domestic law level  
The UK legislator has not, by the 2006 Regulations, gone further than EU law requires by conferring a 
power to award damages in respect of loss or damage suffered by an economic operator in the case of 
any breach, as op posed to only a “sufficiently serious” breach, of the Regulations. The Court of Appeal 
was correct to consider that the explanatory  materials  preceding the amendments to the 2006 
Regulations indicate the  legislator’s intention to do only what was necessary  to implement the 
Remedies Directive without any ‘gold plating’ [33-35]. However, the  Court of Appeal erred in its 
assumption that any claim for damages under the 2006 Regulations was no more than a private law 
claim for breach of a domestically -based stat utory duty, and that this categorisation automatically freed 
the claim from any conditions which would otherwise apply under EU law [37-39]. The scheme of the 
Remedies Directive is a balanced one, with the Francovich conditions representing the Court of Ju stice’s 
conclusion as to the appropriate level of minimum protection by way of damages which an economic 
operator can expect. The UK legislator would not have gone further than required by EU law when 
implementing this scheme  without considering this and m aking it clear [39]. This conclusion is also 
consistent with the use of the word “may” in regs.47I(2) and 47J(2)(c) which would otherwise have no 
real significance [32; 39] .  
 
Issue (iii) – Failure to claim before the contract is made  
ATK cannot be said to  have failed to mitigate (or avoid) its loss  by not having taken steps to prevent 
the NDA from carrying its breach of duty into effect . The remedies scheme aims specifically at giving 
an economic operator the opportunity to stop the wrongful award of a pro curement contract to a 
competitor. But an operator will not act  unreasonably in not taking advantage of that opportunity . The 
scheme gives both parties choices as to how to proceed and how to protect themselves [53-55]. The 
NDA could have delayed entry int o the contract under after the 30 -day period which ATK had to 
commence proceedings. ATK may not have issued its claim form at a time when this would have put 
an automatic stop on the NDA entering into the contract because it appreciated that this would lea d to 
the NDA seeking to lift the stop, and ATK in turn having to put up security for any loss the NDA 
would suffer through the continuation of the stop  [51-52]. An economic operator cannot  be said to 
have acted unreasonably in deciding not to pursue a course which exposes it to the risks associated 
with the possibility of its challenge to the contract award decision failing [54].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the newspaper publishers’ appeals . Lord Neuberger gives 
the lead judgment, with which the other Justices agree.  
  
REASONS FOR THE DECISION  
 
The reasoning of the Strasbourg court in MGN v UK  was full, careful  and largely sound ly based , and  
reflected widespread criticism of the 1999 Act regime which has led to significant changes [32 and 41]. 
However, as the UK Government is not a party to the se appeals , it would be inappropriate to express a 
concluded view as to whether there is a  general rule of domestic law that it would normally infringe a 
newspaper publisher’s rights under Article 10 to require it to reimburse the claimant’s success fee and 
ATE premium  in a defamation or  privacy case , unless it was necessary so to decide, and it is not  [29]. It 
would be  similarly  inappropriate to grant a declaration of incompatibility of legislation containing the 
1999 Act regime or the statutes which superse de it [64]. 
 
Assuming that  there is such a general rule, to deny the claimants in  Miller and Flood  the ability to recover 
the success fee and ATE premium which they had incurred would  infringe their rights  under Article 1 
of the First Protocol to the Convention . They had incurred financial obligations in reliance on a statute  
and had a legitimate expectation that  the statute  would not be retrospectively repealed or otherwise 
invalidated to their detriment [46-48]. It may be that the claimants’  Article 6 and 8 rights would also 
thereby be infringed as  the regime aimed  to enable access to the courts,  and the present proceedings 
were brought  to restore personal dignity  [49-52]. Even if u pholding the costs order in Miller and Flood 
would infringe the newspaper publishers’ article 10 rights for the reasons given in MGN v UK, the 
fundamental principle that citizens are entitled to assume  that the law will not change  retroactively  would 
be directly infringed by the order sought. Freedom  of expression is also a fundamental principle, but one 
which is less centrally engaged by the issue in this case: the infringement of the  newspaper publishers’ 
rights  is based on an indirect chilling effect [53]. The just and appropriate order under section 8(1) of 
the Human Rights Act is therefore to dismiss the appeals , as to allow the m would be a graver 
infringement of the claimants’ rights than the infringement which the newspaper publishers will suffer 
if the appeals are dismissed  [53-54]. In the appeal in Frost, such  a rule could  in any event  have no proper 
application to  facts. The information was obtained illegally and there could have been  no real expectation  
that its publication  would be  in the public interest . The Article 10 rights of the newspaper publishers 
have greatly reduced weight  in this context as compared with those of MGN in MGN v UK  [58-63]. 
 
The trial judge in  Flood was correct to start with the proposition that , prima facie , Mr Flood was the winner  
and ought to receive  his costs  [67]. In considering whether to alter this, the judge was entitled to regard 
TNL’s aggressive and unconstructive attitude in correspondence as militating against departure  [70-71], 
and to find that the co sts of TNL’s defence would have been incurred even if Mr Flood had conceded 
the part of his claim that was eventually unsuccessful [73]. The weight to be given to the fact that Mr 
Flood was only partially successful was a matter for the first instance judg e, as was the decision to award 
costs on the basis that he was the overall winner rather than making an issues -based order [74].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Res inter alios acta  
 
The general rule that loss which has been avoided is not recoverable as damages is subject to an 
exception in respect of collateral payments ( res inter alios acta ), where these are  received independently The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 of the circumst ances giving rise to the loss  [11]. The payments made by Mr Hunt to EMSL and by 
EMSL to Swynson to pay off the 2006 and 2007 loans cannot be regarded as collateral. First, the 
transaction discharged the very liability whose existence represented Swynson’s loss [13]. Secondly, the 
money Mr Hunt lent to EMSL in December 2008 was not an indirect payment to Swynson, even 
though it ultimately reached them. Mr Hunt’s agreement to make that loan and the earlier agreements 
of Swynson to lend money to EMSL were dist inct transactions between different parties, each made 
for valuable consideration  [13]. Thirdly, the consequences of refinancing could not be recoverable as 
the cost of mitigation, because the loan to EMSL was not an act of Swynson and was not attributable  
to HMT’s breach of duty [13; 45; 97 ].  
 
Transferred loss  
 
The judge and Court of Appeal were correct to reject Swynson’s second argument, based on the 
principle of transferred loss. This principle is a limited exception to the general rule that a claimant  can 
recover only loss which he has himself suffered [14-15; 52 -53; 102 -105]. It does not arise here because 
it was no part of the object of the engagement of HMT, or any other aspect of the 2006 transaction, to 
benefit Mr Hunt [17; 54; 108] .  
 
Unjust enri chment  
 
HMT was not unjustly enriched by Mr Hunt’s provision of funds to EMSL to repay Swynson, with the 
result  that Mr Hunt may not be subrogated to Swynson’s claims against them :  
 
i. Lord  Sumption is prepared to assume for the sake of argument that HMT was  enriched  [20], 
while Lord Neuberger and Lord Mance consider that HMT has undoubtedly been enriched in 
economic terms as a result of the discharge by EMSL of the loan due to Swynson [113; 57].  
 
ii. Lord Sumption is again prepared to assume that if HMT was enr iched, it was at Mr Hunt’s 
expense  [20]. Lord Neuberger considers that HMT’ s enrichment was not sufficiently directly 
effected by Mr Hunt’s advance of the new loan [114-115], while Lord Mance notes that the 
questions whether a benefit was obtained “at the expense of” the claimant and whether it 
would be “unjust” for the defendant to retain it are difficult to separate in the present case [58-
68].  
 
iii. Mr Hunt’s case is that the enrichment of HMT was unjust  because he made a mistake in 
assuming that the Decembe r 2008 refinancing would not affect the claim he and/or Swynson 
had against HMT [21; 78]. But the  purpose of the  law of unjust enrichment is to correct 
normatively defective transfers of value  [22; 117] . The role of equitable subrogation in this 
context is  to replicate as far as possible the element of the transaction whose absence made it 
defective [31; 86]. The December 2008 refinancing was not a defective transaction:  Mr Hunt 
got precisel y what he intended to get , namely the discharge of EMSL’s debt to S wynson and a 
right to recover the new loan from EMSL  [32-35; 119; 87]. As Lord Neuberger and Lord 
Mance also note, the  fact that HMT received a benefit as an unforeseen and incidental 
consequence of Mr Hunt’s pursuit of those objectives does not establish any normative or 
basic defect in the arrangements made [117; 87 -89].

 powers of search and confiscation,  does not comply with the 2003 Act and 2005 Regulation s.. Lord 
Hodge  gives the lead judgment, with which the other Justices agree.   
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 
 
The Board is correct that the comprehensive ban, viewed on its own, involves the exercise of a power 
of management under the 1978 Act. However, the supporting prohibition from  possession of tobacco 
products and the power to search for an d confiscate such products fall  within the scope of the 2003 Act 
and the 2005 Regulations [34]. The 2005 Regulations do not set limits on the items which may be 
prohibited or searched for. The focus of section 286  and the 2005 Regulations is on the regulation of 
activi ties which impinge on the autonomy of individuals [38]. The devising of such policies which 
concern the detained patient’s autonomy and the carrying out of such measures have thus become 
functions under the 2003 Act and the section 1 principles apply to such measures in so far as they are 
relevant [38-39]. One relevant principle is  the obligation in section 1(4) to discharge the function in a  
manner that involves  the minimum restriction on the freedom of the patient that is necessary in the 
circumstances [39]. In instituting the comprehensive smoking ban t here was no consideration o f this 
principle by the Board nor was there compliance with the obligations to inform and record  in the 2005 
Regulations [40]. As a result, the prohibition on having tobacco products and the related powers to 
search and confiscate are illegal and fall to b e annulled [41]. 
 
Article 8  
 
Mr McCann’s Article 8 right to privacy has been infringed [43]. The smoking ban is within the ambit of 
Article 8 [57]. Where therapeutic detention has severely curtailed a detained patient’s private space, there 
is a need to protect this residual autonomy by requiring further intrusion into his private life to be 
justified [55]. The decision is not “in accordance with la w” as  the Board failed to address the 
requirements of section 1(4) of the 2003 Act and the 2005 Regulations in relation to  the part of the ban 
relating to the prohibition of possession, searches and confiscation of tobacco products [58]. But for 
this illeg ality, the decision would not have been contrary to Article 8 [62]. The smoking ban pursued the 
legitimate aim of the protection of public health and was rationally connected to that aim [59]. Faced 
with the difficulties of implementing a partial ban, the Board did not act disproportionately in imposing 
the comprehensive smoking ban when it did [60]. 
 
Article 14  
 
The Article 14 challenge fails. The differences in treatment between detained patients in the State 
Hospital and patients in other NHS facilities or prisoners  are a matter of timing rather than policy  as the 
Scottish Government has committed to extending the ban . The earlier  implementation of the 
comprehensive smoking ban in the State Hospital is due to the difficulties faced by the State Hospital in 
operating the  partial ban. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the differences between the 
circumstances of Mr McCann and those of the other groups [64]. Further, there is no unjustified 
discrimination when detained patients are compared with the ge neral public at liberty as the 
circumstances of members of the public are radically different [65].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Toulson, with whom Lord Mance, Lord 
Reed and Lord Hughes agree, gives the lead judgment. Lord Kerr gives a concurring judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Although article 8 is broad, it is not so b road as to encompass every thing done by a public authority 
which has the consequence of affecting someone’s private life in a more than minimal way [25-26]. 
Neither the  Strasbourg authorities  nor domestic ca se law supports the contention that the instituti on 
of criminal proceedings , for a matter which is properly the subject of the criminal law  and for which 
there is sufficient evidence , may be open to challenge on article 8 grounds. It would be illogical; for if 
the matter is properly the subject of the cr iminal law, it is a matter for the processes of the criminal 
law. The criminalisation of conduct may amount to an interference with article 8 rights. However, if it 
does not amount to an unjustifiable interference, then neither does the decision to prosecu te for that 
conduct [31-32].  
 
In this case the decision which is challenged is the initial decision to prosecute. However, it is accepted 
that the offence under section 25 of the 2006 Act is compliant with Convention rights and it was 
conceded in the cour ts below that the CPS was reasonably entitled to consider that the evidential test 
was satisfied at the time when the decision to prosecute was taken.  It is difficult to envisage 
circumstances in which the initiation of a prosecution against a person reaso nably suspected of 
committing a criminal offence could itself be a breach of that person’s human rights. It does not 
matter that prosecution is not obligatory in the UK; whether it is in the public interest to prosecute is 
not the same as whether a prosecu tion would breach an individual’s article 8 rights [34]. Article 8 is 
therefore not applicable to the decision to prosecute [35].  
 
The CPS can be criticised  regarding the  length of  time taken to conclude that the appellant’s  section 31 
defence  would succe ed. However,  even if art icle 8 was applicable, this would not amount to a  breach  
in the decision to prosecute . Even if the original decision to prosecute was an error of judgment by the 
CPS this wou ld not have breached article 8. It would be different if t he the state had deliberately 
trumped up  false charges. However, this would involve the torts of malicious prosecution and/or 
misfeasance in public office, to which article 8 would add nothing [36]. A decision to prosecute does 
not itself involve a lack of  respect for the autonomy of the defendant but places the question of 
determining his or her guilt before the court [38].  
 
Lord Kerr raises the possibility that  the continuation of the decision to prosecute beyond the time that 
it should have been recogni sed that the appellant had an answerable defence under section 31 
constituted  an interference with the appellant’s freedom of liberty under article 5 of the Convention 
and article 8 rights [41-46]. However, argument was not heard on these questions. Lord K err therefore  
also dismisses the appeal. The decision to prosecute did not amount to a  breach of article 8 in 
circumstances where it was accepted there was an evidential basis for prosecu ting the appellant at the 
time of that decision  [47].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Commissioners’ ap peal and dismisses the ITCs’ cross -
appeal . Lord Reed gives the judgment, with which the rest of the Court agrees.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The principal issues to be decided were (i) whether the ITCs in principle could make out a claim in 
unjust enrichment against the Commissioners, (ii) whether such a claim was excluded by the 
statutory scheme under s.80 and (iii) whether the lack of any such claim was  incompatible with EU 
law.  
 
The extent of th e Commissioners ’ enrichment was limited to the notional £75 which they  received 
from the Managers . It did not include the notional £25 which the Managers retained  as an input tax  
credit, because that was not an amount which the Com missioners owed to the Ma nagers:  it was 
only deductible from output tax that was properly due  [25-31]. As to whether the Commissioners’ 
enrichment was at the expense of the ITCs, there has been uncertainty surrounding the  approach to 
be ad opted . It would be  unwise to attempt a def initive statement of the circumstances in which the 
“at the expense of” requirement would be satisfied, but  as a general rule it will be satisfied where 
there is a direct transfer of value from the claimant to the defendant , and in situations equivalent to  
direct transfers, for example where an agent is interposed, or where a series of coordinated 
transactions can be treated as a single transaction. A further situation where the requirement is 
satisfied is where the claimant discharges a debt owed by the de fendant to a third party. The 
possibility of genuine exceptions to a direct provision rule should not be ruled out, but beyond 
direct transfers of value, or equivalent situations, it is generally difficult to maintain that the 
defendant has been enriched a t the claimant’s expense. For there to be a transfer of value, the 
claimant must incur a loss through the provision of the benefit:  incidental benefits alone cannot  
constitute a transfer of value  [32-66]. In the present case  there is no direct transfer of value, or 
equivalent situation. The ITCs ’ payment to the Managers became part of the Managers ’ general 
assets, and was not impress ed with a special purpose trust, while the Managers’ VAT liability to the 
Commissioners arose independently of whether the ITC s actually paid VAT. The two transactions 
are separate and cannot be collapsed into a single transfer of value fro m the ITCs to the 
Commissioners  [67-74]. 
 
Even if the ITCs had in principle been able to make out a claim in unjust enrichment, such a claim 
would have been excluded by s.80. The statute creates an exhaustive code of remedies not just for 
suppliers who have accounted to the Commissioners, but for the ultimate consumers as well. This 
is because it set out arrangements for the supplier to reimburs e the consumer , subject to a 
limitation period , removing the need for the consumer to have a direct remedy against the 
Commissioners. Parliament cannot have intended this scheme for reimbursement of consumers to 
exist concurrently with non -statutory liabil ities – that would be inconsistent with the rationale of 
the statutory scheme  [75-88].  
 
The application of the statutory scheme in the present case is compatible with EU law. The 
European Court of Justice has accepted that in principle, a system under whi ch only the supplier is 
entitled to seek reimbursement of VAT from the tax authorities, and the consumer can seek 
restitution from the supplier, meets the requ irements of EU law. I n cases where the reimbursement 
of the consumer by the supplier would be impossible or ex cessively  difficult, the principle of 
effectiveness would require that the consumer be able to bring a claim directly against the tax 
authorities. That was not the case here, and it would not be appropriate to consider what the 
position would be in a hypothetical case where a supplier was insolvent  [89-94].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the Council’s appeal , declaring that the wor d ‘regularly’ means 
‘in accordance with the rules prescribed by the school’ . Lady Hale, with whom the other Justices agree, 
gives the only judgment.  
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The history of the law preceding section 444 (1) of the Education Act 1996 shows  that before 1944 it 
was well established that the offence of failing to cause a child to attend school without a reasonable 
excuse could be committed by a single day’s absence [8-14]. The Education Act 1944 replaced the 
concept of reasonable excuse with a  closed list of circumstances in which absence was permitted , and 
provided that the offence would be committed if the child failed to attend school ‘regularly’ . This  
provision  was reproduced in the Education Act 1993 and is now found in s 444 (1) of the 199 6 Act The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 [15-19]. The penalty notice regime is an alternative to immediate prosecution and offers a parent the 
opportunity of escaping liability to conviction by paying the penalty [21].  
 
The question for the Supreme Court is which  meaning of the word ‘regul arly’ was intended by 
Parliament when enacting s 444(1).  It plainly i s not ‘at regular intervals’ as this would mean attendance 
at school once a week is regular even though attendance every day is required by the rules. ‘Sufficiently 
frequently’ was the me aning assumed in some earlier cases , and in the lower courts  in this case, but 
there a re many reasons to think that this was not what Parliament intended in 1944 or in 1996 : 
 
 School attendance is compulsory and there are rules about when it is required [32].  
 The purpose of the 1944 act was to increase the scope and character of compulsory state 
education and it is implausible to suggest that it was intended t o relax the previous obligation  
on parents to secure their children’s attendance [33].  
 The defences  were tightened in 1944 and the flexibility inherent in a ‘reasonable excuse’ was 
removed [34].  
 The exception for absence on a single day for religious observance in s 444(3) would not be 
needed unless it would otherwise amount to a failure to attend regu larly [35].  
 Provisions for parents with an itinerant trade or business did not suggest that ‘regularly’ was a 
matter of fact and degree [36]. 
 A boarder fails to attend regularly under s 444(7) if he is absent without leave during any part 
of the school te rm, and there is no reason why 100% attendance should be required of 
boarders but not of day pupils [37].  
 This interpretation is far too uncertain to found a criminal offence. A parent would not know 
on any given day whether removing the child from school  is a criminal offence [39]. 
 There are sound policy reasons for rejecting this interpretation because of the disruptive 
impact of the absence for the education  of the individual child and of the  other pupils [40]. 
 It permits an approach to rule keeping whi ch no educational system can be expected to find 
acceptable [41]. 
 
These reasons also point toward s the correct interpretation of ‘regularly’ being  ‘in accordance with the 
rules’. A sensible prosecution policy will allow minor or trivial breaches to be dea lt with appropriately  
[43]. This was not thought to be a problem under the pre -1944 law [44]. The rule that statutes 
imposing criminal liability must enable everyone to know what is and is not an offence is important 
[45].  This interpretation is consistent  with the provisions excepting from the scope of the offence a 
child absent with the leave of the school  [46], and with the obligation on  parents to cause the ir child to 
receive ‘full -time’ education under section 7 of the 1996 act [47].   
 
Accordingly, th e penalty notice was properly issued to Mr Platt and , having not paid the penalty fine,  
he should have been convicted of the offence  unless he can establish one of the statutory exceptions . 
The case is therefore returned to the magistrates with a direction  to proceed as if his submission of no 
case to answer had been rejected  [49].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The concept of indirect discrimination has following salient features:  
 There has never been any express requirement for an explanation of the reasons why a particular 
PCP puts one group at a disadvantage when compared with others. It is enough that it does [24].  
 Indirect discrimination, unlike direct discrimination, does not require a causal link between the 
characteristic and the  treatment but does require a causal link between the PCP and the particular 
disad vantage suffered [25]. 
 The reason  for the disadvantage may not be in itself unlawful , or within the  control of the 
employer , but both the PCP and the  reason for the disadvantage must be  ‘but for’ causes of the 
disadvantage [26]. 
 The PCP need not put every member of the group sharing the protected characteristic at a 
disadvantage. In the Essop  case, it was irrelevant that some BME  or olde r candidates could pass 
the CSA : the group was at a disadvantage because the proportion who could pass was smaller than 
the proportion of white or younger candidates [27]. 
 It is commonplace for the disparate impact , or particular disadvantage , to be established on the 
basis of statistical evidence [28]. 
 It is always open to a respondent to show that the PCP is justified. There may well be a good 
reason for it. A wise employer  will, however, try to see if PCPs which do have a disparate impact 
can be modified to remove that impact while achieving the desired result [29]. 
 
The disadvantage suffered by the individual must correspond with the disadvantage suffered by the group. 
The disadvantage in Essop  was that members of the group failed the CSA disprop ortionately and the 
appellants suffered this  disadvantage. However , a candidate who fails the CSA  because he did not prepare 
or di d not turn up for or finish the CSA  has not suffered harm as a result of the PCP in question  and in 
such a case it is open to the respondent to show that the causal link between the PCP and the  individual 
disadvantage is  absent . The Essop  appeal  is therefore allowed and the claims are remitted to the 
Employment Tribunal [30-36]. 
 
In Mr Naeem’s case the reason why the pay scale pu ts Muslim chaplains at a disadvantage is known. It is 
because they have on average shorter  lengths of service than Christian chaplains [37]. The Court of Appeal 
was wrong to require the reason to relate to the protected characteristic [39]. The pool of com parators 
comprises all workers affected by the PCP in question. In this case the incremental pay structure affected 
all chaplains in the Prison Service and this did pu t the Muslim chaplains at a disadvantage compared with 
the Christians [42]. As regards ju stification, it was not in dispute that the pay scheme had a legitimate aim 
but the means adopted needed to be proportionate. The Employment Tribunal found as a fact that six 
years was the most required for newly appointed chaplains to have the skills and experience for reward at 
the top of the scale , but that in the circumstances the disadvantage suffered by Mr Naeem was no more 
than was necessary as the transition to a new shorter pay scale took its course.  This was the correct test . It 
is not open to the  courts on  an appeal to disturb that finding, even if there were alternative means to 
reduce the disadvantage more quickly which could have been considered [43-47]. Mr Naeem’s appeal is 
therefore dismissed.

On the main issue in the appeal the Supreme Court makes a reference to the Court of Justice of th e

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
On the primary issue in the appeal, the Court decides t hat a reference to the CJEU is necessary to reach a 
conclusion [3]. Its questions to the CJEU include: w here general overhead costs attributed to hire 
purchase transactions (which consist of exempt supplies of finance and taxable supplies of cars), have 
been incorporated only into the price of the taxable person’s exempt supplies of finance, does the taxable 
person have a right to deduct any of the input tax on those costs?  Further, c an it be legitimate in principle 
to ignore the value of the taxable suppli es of cars (or their value) for the purposes of arriving at a special 
method under Article 173(2)(c) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC?   
 
Determination of the secondary issue does not require examination of general questions about the 
tribunal’s role. One of the strengths of the tribunal system is the flexibility of its procedures, which need to 
be adapted to a wide range of types of case and litigant. There may be some circumstances where a more 
inquisitorial approach is appropriate, but where the tribunal  is dealing with substantial litigants represented 
by experience d counsel, it is entitled to assume that the parties will have identified what they regard as 
relevant issues for decision [7]. 
 
Particular importance is attached to the tribunal’s understandi ng of the issue before it, as apparent from 
the tribunal’s own introduction to the detailed discussion  at paragraph 41  [8]. The Court has no material 
to go behind the clear statement of the position as the tribunal understood it, having itself apparently 
sought clarification. If the tribunal was thought to have misunderstood the appellant’s position and failed 
to deal with a significant issue, the matter could have been raised with them and sorted out at that point  
[9]. As the tribunal’s understanding is co nsistent with the lack of any specific reference to this issue in the 
appellant’s written submissions or  in the evidence  of its witness , this ground of appeal is dismissed.

REASONS FOR TH E JUDGMENT  
 
Article 6  
 
Section 39(2)(a)(i) is not within the ambit of Article 6 . Section 39(2)(a)(i) did not create an irrebuttable 
presumption that the appellant did not have a reasonable belief as to the age of the girl with whom he 
had sexual intercours e, thereby overriding the presumption of innocence in Article 6(2). The provision 
created what amounts to a strict liability offence, by treating as irrelevant the accused person’s 
knowledge of the victim’s age. Such an offence does not violate Article 6(2 ), which is concerned with 
procedural guarantees and not with the substantive elements of a criminal offence [21].  
 
Article 8  
 
There was an interference  with Article 8 which requires to be justified under Article 8(2) because the 
prosecutor relied on the earlier police charge in the criminal proceedings [23-24, 56-57]. 
 
Lord Hodge concludes that s ection 39(2)(a)(i) is incompatible with the appellant’s Article 8 rights [47]. 
The exclusion of  the reasonable belief defence in this case is a disproportionate i nterference with the 
appellant’s Article 8 rights because the prior charges did not give the official warning or notice that 
consensual sexual activity with children between the ages of 1 3 and 16 is an offence [44]. Those  prior 
charges were not charges of sexual activity with a child aged between 13 and 16 and therefore did not 
provide such a warning [29]. The list of “relevant sexual offences” includes charges in which the age 
of the victim is not an essential component, extends far beyond consensual sexua l activity with an 
older child and excludes charges  where the charged person was an older child at the time of the charge. 
This suggests that section 32(2)(a)(i) is likely in many other cases to give rise to infringements of article 
8 because the prior cha rge does not objectively give the relevant warning [45, 47].  
 
Lord Reed agrees that the interference with the Article 8 right is not proportionate where the necessary 
link between the prior charge and the supposed warning does not exist [66]. The  difficult y arises from 
the width of the definition  of “relevant sexual offences”. Since such offences are not confined to 
sexual conduct which is illegal because it is with children , prior charges of such offences cannot be taken 
to have alerted the accused to the importance of making sure that a person is over 16 before engaging 
in sexual activities. Further, since the definition includes non -consensual offences, prior charges  
relating to those offences  cannot be taken to have alerted the accused to the importance of age in the 
context of consensual sexual conduct [64]. The definition also excludes consensual sexual activities 
between older children, perhaps the clearest example of a situation where the charge alerts the person 
charged to the importance of the age o f consent when engaging in consensual sexual behaviour [65]. 
 
Article 14  
 
In light of the conclusions in relation to Article 8, it is unnecessary to discuss this challenge [46, 67] . 
 
Remedy  
 
It is not possible  to interpret section 3 9(2)(a)(i) narrowly to b ring it within the competence of the 
Parliament [48, 66]. Section 3 9(2)(a)(i) is therefore not law [66] and proceedings are remitted to the 
High Court of Justiciary to exercise t he power to suspend or vary the effect of this decision  [49-50].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  Capita’s appeal.  Lord Hodge  gives the lead judgment, with 
which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Contractual Interpretation  
 
The court must ascertain the objective meaning of the contractual language. It must consider the 
contract as a whole and, depending on the natu re, formality and quality of its drafting, give more or 
less weight to elements of the wider context in reaching its view as to that objective meaning [10]. 
Where there are rival meanings, the court can reach a view as to which construction is more consist ent 
with business common sense. However, in striking a balance between the indications given by the 
language and the practical implications of competing constructions, the court must consider the quality 
of the drafting of the clause. It must be alive to t he possibility that one side may have agreed 
something which in hindsight did not serve his interest , or that a provision may be a negotiated 
compromise [11]. It does not matter whether the detailed analysis commences with the factual 
background and the practical implications o f rival constructions or with an examination of the 
contractual language, so long as the court balances the indications given by each [12].  
 
Textualism and contextualism are not conflicting paradigms in a battle for the exclusive occ upation of 
the field of contractual interpretation [13]. On the approach to contractual interpretation, Rainy Sky 
and Arnold  were saying the same thing [14]. 
 
Clause 7.11  
 
The Court of Ap peal was correct on the meaning of clause 7.11  [25]. Careful examinat ion of the 
contractual language identifies the circumstances which trigger the clause [42]. Capita’s suggested 
construction is unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, the suggestion  that only the “fines, compensation or 
remedial action or payments imposed on th e Company” had to arise out of complaints made to the 
FSA against the Company  would not restrict the scope of the warranty in any way. The source of loss 
and damage in the rest of the clause would remain unlimited. Secondly, it would have the effect that 
the clause would fail to specify against whom the relevant actions, proceedings and claims in the 
remainder of the clause could be made. There must be a limit on who such persons could be as it 
would be absurd for Capita to have a claim against the Sellers for indemnity resulting from any mis -
selling on its part before the Completion Date  [33-35]. 
 
The contractual  context  is also significant in this case. The mis -selling which clause 7.11 addr esses is 
also covered by the Schedule 4  warranties , which concern  compliance and regulatory matters. The 
scope of clause 7.11, breach of which gives rise to a liability unlimited in time, must  be assessed in the 
context of the detailed and time -limited warranties  in Schedule 4  [27]. Capita had two years after 
completing the purchase to make a claim under Schedule 4. That was not an unreasonable time scale. 
It is not contrary to business common sense for the parties to agree wide -ranging warranties, which are 
subject to a time limit, and to agree a further indemnity, which  is not subject to any such limit but is 
triggered only  in limited circumstances [40]. The SPA may have become a bad bargain from Capita’s 
standpoint, as it appears it did not notify the sellers of a warranty claim within two years of 
Completion. But it is  not the function of the court to improve their bargain [41].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal, but for reasons different from those given by 
the Court of Appeal.  Lord Sumption delivers the sole  judgment. He ho lds that the non -disclosure of 
the amount of commissions and the identit y of the recipients did make Mrs Plevin’s  relationship with 
Paragon unfair under s 140A (1)(c)  of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 , but the failure to conduct a 
needs assessment of Mrs Plev in did  not. The case is remitted to the Manchester County Court to 
decide what if any relief under s 140B should be ordered unless that can be agreed.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The non -disclosure of the commissions  
 
 The Court of Appeal’s decision in Harrison v Black Horse Ltd [2012] Lloyd’s Rep IR 521 was 
wrong . The ICOB R ules are hard -edged, imposing a minimum standard of conduct applicable 
in a wide range of situations and providing for damages in the event of breach, whereas s 140A 
of the Consumer Cre dit Act 1974 introduces a broader test of fairness which is a matter for the 
court’s judgment and which potentially takes into account a much wider range of factors. They 
are asking different questions  [14-17]. 
 Applying s 140A, Lord Sumption concludes that  the non -disclosure of the commissions did 
make the relationship between Paragon and Mrs Plevin unfair.  At some point, the 
commissions may become so large that the relationship cannot be regarded as fair if the 
customer is kept in ignorance. This case lay far beyond the tipping point. Mrs Plevin would 
have questioned  whether the PPI represented value for money if she had been aware of the 
commission amounts and might not have taken out PPI at all [18]. This unfairness was the 
responsibility of Paragon, the only party which knew the size of both commissions [19-20]. 
 
Failure to assess the suitability of PPI insurance for Mrs Plevin’s needs  
 
 Paragon’s own failure to conduct their own needs assessment of Mrs Plevin did not make its 
relationship with her unfair.  The absence of a regulatory duty under the ICOB Rules was not 
conclusive, but it was highly relevant: Paragon could not reasonably be expected to perform a 
duty which the relevant statutory code assigned to someone else , namely LLP  [26]. 
 LLP’s failure to conduct a needs assessment of Mrs Plevin could not be treated as something 
done “by or on behalf of” Paragon , because LLP was not acting as Paragon’s agent . The 
ordinary and natural meaning of the words “on behalf of” import s agency, and that is how the 
courts have ordinarily  construed them.  Nothing in this case demands a broader interpretation. 
The phrase “by or on behalf of” suggests that the act or omission must be done by the creditor 
itself, or by someone else whose acts and omissions engage the credit or’s responsibility as if the 
creditor had done or not done it itself. Further, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 makes extensive 
use of the technique of imputing responsibility to the creditor for the acts or omissions of 
other parties who are not (or not nece ssarily) the creditor’s agents, including in s 140A(3), and 
when it does so, it does so in clear terms. Finally, there would be no coherent criteria for 
determining what connection other than agency would be required between the creditor and 
the acts or om issions causing the unfairness  [27-34].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  N’s parents’ appeal . Although the C ourt of Protection had 
jurisdiction to continue with the planned hearing, it did not have power to order the respondent to 
fund the p arents’ plan, nor to order the actual care providers to do that which they were unwilling or 
unable to do . The judge had  therefore been entitled to conclude that no useful purpose was served by 
continuing the hearing. Lady Hale, w ith whom all the Justices agree , gives the only judgment.

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The jurisdiction of the Court of Protection is limited to decisions that a person (‘P’) could take if he 
had the capacity to do so . It is not to be equated with the jurisdiction of the courts t o make orders in 
respect of children: under the MCA the court does not become the guardian of an adult who lacks 
capacity and the adult does not become the ward of  the court [24]. The MCA focuses  on capacity in 
relation to a specific decision or matter . Rather than granting declaratory relief available under section 
15, it is better if possible for the court to make order s under section 16 [26]. There is scope under 
section 16 for the court to make a decision on P’s behalf , or to appoint a deputy to make su ch 
decisions , and the court’s powers set out in section 17 include the power to decide where P is to live 
and what contact, if any, P is to have with any specified persons . The se powers do  not extend to 
decisions compelling third parties to accommodate, or  meet, or to provide services or treatments for P 
[29].  
 
The fact that the court has no greater power to take a decision than P would have had himself means 
that it too can only choose between the ‘available options’.  It resembles the inability of the fam ily court 
in children cases to oblige an unwilling parent to have the child to live with him , or to oblige an 
unwilling health service to provide a particular treatment for the child [35]. Nor can the court use its  
powers to put pressure upon a local autho rity to make particular decisions in exercise of its statutory 
powers and duties to provide public services. Such decisions can instead be challenged on judicial 
review principles, where the legal considerations for the public authority and for the court w ill be 
different from those under the MCA [37].  
 
It was unfortunate in N’s case that the issue was described as one of ‘jurisdiction’  since the C ourt of 
Protection  clearly has jurisdiction  to make declarations and orde rs under the MCA. The question wa s 
rather how N’s case should be handled in the light of the limited powers of the court [38]. The court 
has wide case management powers, which include the identif ication of  issues which need full 
investigation, and it is entitled to take the view that no useful  purpose will be served by holding a 
hearing to resolve other issues [41]. In this case , there were good reasons for thinking that N’s parents’ 
wishes were impracticable and that the respondent had good reasons for rejecting them. The Official 
Solicitor su pported the respondent. It was unlikely that investigation would bring about any further 
modifications or consensus and it would be disproportionate to devote any more of the court’s scarce 
resources to resolving matters [42].  
 
Accordingly, since the court  did not have power to order the respondent to fund what N’s parents 
wanted, nor to order the actual care providers to do that which they were unwilling or unable to do, 
the judge was entitle to conclude (as in substance she had) that no useful purpose wou ld be served by 
continuing the hearing [44]. The appeal is therefore dismissed.

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to deal with this application  and it is proper to exercise it . Section 
40(5) of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 empowers  the Court “to determine any question 
necessary to be determined for the purposes of doing justice in an appeal to it under any enactment”. 
Rule 46 of the Supreme Court Rules 2009  further provides t hat the court may make such costs orders 
as it considers just , and that i t may do so either at final determination of an appeal , or application for 
permission to appeal , or in the course of proceedings. It is not usual for the court to decide an issue 
going to costs before the hearing of the substantive appeal. However, the ruling is necessary now to 
enable the trustee to decide whether to proceed , and the court is in as good a position to decide this 
issue now as it would be  later: the application does not  raise any discretionary considerations, nor does 
it affect the propriety of any decision of the trustee to pursue the appeal . [6-8] 
 
The Court of Appeal authority Borneman v Wilson (1884) 28 Ch D 53 suggests that a trustee in 
bankruptcy must either adopt proceedings in their entirety or not at all, even where there are discrete 
prior proceedings conducted by the bankrupt before his appointment. At that time, the court did not 
have jurisdiction to award costs against a non -party , which would have include d the bankrupt where 
the trustee had  been substituted for the bankrupt; moreover, liability under such an order would not 
have been provable against the estate because of a line of case -law which said that such liability was 
not contingent at the time of bank ruptcy. The jurisdiction to award costs against a non -party was 
recognised by the House of Lords in 1986 and the possibility of proving liability under a costs order 
against a company in liquidation, and consequently also against a bankrupt’s estate, was r ecognised by 
the Supreme Court in 2014. The reasons behind  the Court of Appeal’s conclusion in Borneman  are 
therefore no longer relevant and it is possible to revisit the issue as a matter of principle. [11-14] 
 
It may be appropriate as a matter of discret ion to order a trustee in bankruptcy to pay the other side’s 
costs of legal proceedings including those incurred before the trustee became a party, but there is no 
longer any absolute rule to that effect. [15] But the issue in this app lication  does not con cern that 
discretionary assessment. A trial and the successive appeals from the order made at trial are distinct 
proceedings in the same action and a distinct order for costs is made in respect of each stage . [16] Mr 
Gabriel was responsible for the entire conduct of the trial and the appeal to the Court of Appeal, and 
the costs order which was made against him by the Court of Appeal is a provable debt in his 
bankruptcy. It would be contrary to principle for Mr Hughes -Holland to be held liable for costs in t he 
proceedings below , as this would merely give the solicitors  an unwarranted priority for their  claim 
under the Court of Appeal’s costs order. [17]

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Extra Division  and the Lord Ordinary were correc t to conclude that t he Commission  did not err 
in law in any of the ways suggested by the appellant.  
 
The Commission was right to take into account  the fact that the appellant had not disputed the 
veracity of what he had told the police in the interview. The fact that the evidence in question was and 
remains undisputed is plainl y relevant to whether it is in the interests of justice to make a reference. It 
would not normally be in the interests of justice to quash a conviction merely because, under the law 
as now understood, there was a lack of admissible corroboration of a fact which had never been in 
dispute.  While it is a relevant consideration that if the appellant had been offered the opportunity to 
consult a solicitor, matters might have taken a differe nt course, and the interview might not have 
provided the necessary corroboration that sexual intercourse had occurred, it is also relevant that it was 
because of the answers given at interview, and the admissibility of those answers under the law at the 
time, that the semen found on the swabs were not submitted to examination, so as potentially to 
provide other corroborative evidence. These considerations do not however detract from the relevance 
of the fact that the truth of what was said at interview was and remains undisputed.  [37-39] 
 
The Commission was also correct to take into account the fact that the appellant had not challenged 
the fairness of the  way in which the interview had been conducted or its use at the  trial. Prior to Cadder 
there were well -established grounds of objection on which the appellant could have relied  in the event 
of unfairness  in the conduct of the interview or the use made of it at the trial , and his failure to do so 
was plainly relevant to where the interests of justice lay. [40] 
 
It was also a relevant consideration  that the appellant had relied on the interview in order to present 
his defence  to the jury . The appellant’s argument was that this course of action was forced upon him. 
Although the appellant’s admission that sexual  intercourse had taken place was admissible under the 
law as it then stood, he was entitled to have the whole of the interview placed bef ore the jury so that 
they were aware that  the admission was made in the context of his contention that the sexual 
intercourse had been consensual. The result was that, although the appellant was entitled to give 
evidence in his own defence, he did not have to do so  in order for his defence to be placed before the 
jury. He could therefore avoid  exposing his defence to cross -examination.  That afforded him an 
opportunity which would not have existed if the interview had been inadmissible. In the event, he 
availed himself of that opportunity. [41] 
 
The Commission’s approach to the “interests of justice” test in s.1 94C of the Ac t was not inconsistent 
with the application in the case law of the corresponding test in s.194D A, which applied to the High 
Court. The High Court has not treated its decision under s.194D A as identical to that of the 
Commission under s.194C; although the p ower to refer is couched in the same language, the role of 
each body is different.  Further, the authorities relied on by the appellant in any event concerned 
different circumstances . [42-50]

Lord Sumption  holds that a person is identified in a noti ce under section 393  “if he is identified by name or 
by a synonym for him, such as his office or job title ”.  In the case of a synonym it must be apparent from the 
notice itself that it could only apply to one person and that person must be identifiable from 
information which is either in the notice or publicly available elsewhere. However, resort to 
information publicly available elsewhere is permissible only where it enables one to interpret (as 
opposed to supplement) the language of the notice. It is not permissible to resort to additional facts 
about the person so that if those facts and the notice are placed si de by side it becomes apparent  that 
they refer to the same person  [11]. 
 
Lord Sumption  gives five reasons: (i) section 393 defines what fairness requires in the context of 
notices issued by the FCA  [12]; (ii) it is clear from the provision that it must be the reasons contained 
in the notice which identify the third party and not an extrinsic source  [13]; (iii) the Act must be read 
in a manner which enables the FCA to ensure that a third party  is not “ identified ” in the notice, when it 
does not know precisely what information is available elsewhere  [14]; (iv) the relevant audience for 
publication is the public at large, not a specific industry sector  specially familiar with the third party or 
his business  [15]; and (v) the suggested analogy with the law of defamation is not helpful given its 
different purpose to  that of  section 393 of the Act  [16]. 
 
Lord Neuberger  points out that the wider the scope of section 393(1)(a), the more constraining it  will 
be on the FCA’s activities; but the narrower it is the greater the number of individuals who will be at 
risk of being harmed by notices without any recourse [23]. The question to be asked is: does the notice 
identify the individual in question? The s tatutory language appears to stipulate that the person must be 
identified in the notice, not that he must be identifiable as a result of the notice [25]. Lord Neuberger 
describes the test as whether the individual is “ named in the notice, or the descriptio n in the notice must be 
equivalent to naming him ”. An individual is “ identified ” in a document if: (i) his position or office is 
mentioned, (ii) he is the sole holder of that position or office, and (iii) reference by members of the 
public to freely and pu blicly available sources of information would easily reveal the name of that 
individual by reference to his position or office [26]. 
 
Lord Neuberger also points to a number of problems if a wider meaning is adopted: (i) it would be a 
matter of subjective a ssessment as to how wide a scope to give it; (ii) it could self -evidently lead to 
disputes; (iii) it could lead to some odd consequences; (iv) it would place the FCA in difficulty from the 
outset; and (v) it could still lead to arbitrary outcomes [28]. 
 
Lord Wilson dissents  on the ground that the majority’s approach does not strike a fair balance between 
individual reputation and regulatory efficiency [44]. The central issue of construction in the appeal 
relates to the appropriate constituency – whether it is ordinary readers or ordinary market operators 
who would conclude  that the individual to whom the notice refers is the applicant [59]. The answer is 
by reference to the particular sort of damage which a wrong criticism of an individual by a notice is 
likely to cause him: that from within the sector of the market in which he operates [60].  Lord Wilson 
agrees in essence with the formulation of Lord Mance:  the key question being  are the words in the 
notice such as would reasonably lead an operator in the sa me sector of the market who is not 
personally acquainted with the applicant, by reference only to information in the public domain to 
which he would have ready access, to conclude that the individual referred to in the notice is the 
applicant [63]? However , in his application of that test, Lord Mance concludes  that CIO London 
management did not equate with or identify Mr Macris, and that no information had been shown to 
exist in the public domain which, when read with the notice, identified him with CIO Lon don 
Management. [39]. On this basis, Lord Mance agrees with the majority in the outcome of the appeal.

The Supreme Court unanimously allows AIG’s appeal. Lord Toulson, with whom the other justices 
agree gives the lead judgment.  
 
REASONS F OR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Clause 2.5(a)(iv) MTC has two separate limbs, each of which must be satisfied in order for it to apply. 
The first is that the claims arose from “similar acts or omissions”. It is not in dispute that this  is 
satisfied in this case . The seco nd is the requirement that the claims were  “in a series of related matters 
or transactions”. This is an important limitation, without which the scope for aggregation would be 
almost limitless [17, 22] . However, it is difficult to understand what the Court of Appeal meant by the 
term “intrinsic” in the context of a relationship between two transactions [21]. The use of the word 
‘related’ implies that there must be some interconnection between the matters or transactions, however 
the Law Society did not see i t fit to circumscribe this limb by any particular criteria, such as “intrinsic”.  
This is unsurprising since determining whether transactions are related is an acutely fact sensitive 
exercise [22].  
 
The application of the aggregation clause is not to be vi ewed from the perspective of any particular 
party. It is to be judged objectively, taking the transactions in the round [25].  The starting point is to 
identify the relevant matter or transactions  [23, 27] . The transaction s in this case  involved an 
investm ent in a particular development scheme under a contractual arrangement that was primarily 
bilateral , but had an important trilateral compo nent by reason of the solicitors’  role as trustees and 
escrow agent [23]. The transactions entered into in respect of each development were connected in 
significant way s. Each set of investors in vested in a common development, they were participants in a  
standard scheme and co -beneficiaries under a common trust [24]. On the facts as they currently 
appear, the claims of ea ch group of investors arise from acts or omissions in a series of related 
transactions; the transactions shared a common underlying objective of the execution of a particular 
development project and also fitted together legally through the trusts [26]. How ever, the transactions 
entered into by the Peninsula Village investors cannot  be said to be related to those entered into by the 
Marrakech investors. Th ey related to different sites, had different groups of investors  and were 
protected by different deeds  of trust over different assets . They should therefore not be aggregated 
together  [27]. A number of investors transferred their investment s from Peninsula Village to the 
Marrakech development, entering into a new loan agre ement and new escrow agreement. On t he facts 
as they currently appear, any claim made by such an investor  in respect of the Peninsula Village 
development should be aggregated with the claims made by the other investors in that development  
and any claim made by that investor in respect of the  Marrakech development should be aggregated 
with their first claim [29].

The District Judge did not make either of the two errors on which the Court of Appeal relied to revisit 
his award, and so the Court of Appeal ’s order must be set aside  and the District Judge’s order restored .  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom

The matters to which the court must have regard  in exercising its power to award reasonable financial 
provision are listed under s.3 of the Act. For an applicant other than a spouse or partner, reasonable 
financial provision is limited to what it would be reasonable for her to receive for maintenance o nly. 
This is an  objective standard, to be determined by the court. Th e limitation to maintenance provision 
represents a deliberate legislative choice and demonstrates the significance attached by English law to 
testamentary freedom . Maintenance cannot exte nd to any or everything which it would be desirable for 
the claimant to have , but is not limited to subsistence level. The level at which maintenance may be 
provided is clearly flexible and falls to be assessed on the facts of each case , as at the date of hearing. 
Although maintenance is by definition the provision of income rather than capital, it may be provided 
by way of a lump sum. [12-25] 
 
As to the first suggested error, the process suggested by the Court of Appeal is not warranted by the 
Act. The Act  does not require the judge to fix some hypothetical standard o f reasonable provision and 
then increase or discount it with reference to variable factors. All of the  s.3 factors, so far as they are 
relevant, must be considered, and in light of them a singl e assessment of reasonable financial provision 
should be made. The District Judge worked through each of the s.3 factors, and was entitled to take 
into account the nature of the relationship between Mrs Jackson and Mrs Ilott in reaching his 
conclusion. As to the second suggested error, the District Judge specifically addressed the impact on 
benefits twice. The Court of Appeal’s criticism that his award was of little or no value to Mrs Ilott was 
unjustified. A substantial part of the award could be spent on replacing old and worn out household 
equipment which the family had previously been unable to afford. This fell within the provision of 
maintenance of daily living, and would avoid Mrs Ilott retaining capital for long above the £16,000 
threshold. [29-41] 
 
Reasonable financial provision  can in principle include the provision of housing, but ordinarily by 
creating a life interest rather than a capital and inheritable sum, which possibility appeared not to have 
been considered  by the Court of Appeal . To the ex tent that the benefits means test was relevant, it was 
likely to apply also to the additional sum of £20,000 apparently awarded with a view to avoiding that 
test. The statement in the Court of Appeal that a claimant in receipt of benefits should be treated  in 
the same way as a disabled claimant was problematic; what must have been meant was that receipt of 
means tested benefits is likely to be a relevant indication of a claimant’s financial position. Finally, the 
Court of Appeal’s order gave little weight t o Mrs Jackson’s very clear wishes and the long period of 
estrangement. The Court of Appeal’s justification for this approach was that the charities had little 
expectation of benefit either. This approach should be treated with caution, given the importance  of 
testamentary  bequests for charities, and because the testator’s chosen beneficiaries , whether relatives , 
charities or otherwise , do not need to justify their claim either by need or by expectation. [44-47] 
 
Lady Hale  in her judgment reviews the history  of the Act and preceding legislation.  She comments on 
the unsatisfactory state of the law, giving as it does no guidance as to the weight of the factors to be 
taken into account in deciding whether an adult child is deserving or undeserving of reasonable  
maintenance. The approach under the Act invariably involves a value judgment, which may be 
problematic as t here is a wide range of opinion among the public and the judiciary about the 
circumstances in which adult descendants ought or ought not to be able to make a claim on an estate 
which would otherwise go elsewhere . [49-66]

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Section 103(5) of the 1996 Act  
 
The Court of Appeal’s order was not justified by reference to s.103(5). Nothing in s.103(2) or (3) (or in 
the underlying provisions of article V of the New York Convention) provides a power to make an 
enforcing court’s decision on an issue raised under these provisions conditional on an award debtor 
providing security in respe ct of the award. This is in marked contrast to s.103(5), which specifically 
provides that security may be ordered where there is an adjournment within its terms [24].  
 
The Court also erred in treating its order that the English Commercial Court should dec ide the fraud 
issue as involving an “adjournment” of the decision on that issue within the terms of s.103(5). Section  
103(5) concerns the situation where an enforcing court adjourns its decision on enforcement under 
s.103(2) or (3) while an application for  setting aside or suspension of the award is pending before the 
court of the country in, or under the law of which, the award was made. It does not extend to delays in 
the decision -making process occurring while a decision of an issue under s.103(2) or (3)  is made [25-
26]. Further , s.103(5) contemplates an order for security being made “on the application of the party 
claiming recognition or enforcement of the award”. The reasoning in Dardana v Yukos [2002] confirms 
that security pending the outcome of fore ign proceedings is, in effect, the price of an adjournment which 
an award debtor is seeking; it is not to be imposed on an award debtor who is resisting adjournment on 
properly arguable grounds [27-29]. In the present case, there was no adjournment under s .103(5) onto 
which to hang, as the price, a requirement of further security [30-32]. The Court of Appeal’s further 
reasons for imposing the security, including as an incentive to securing finality in the context of lengthy 
delays, do not go to the jurisdic tion or power to order security under s.103 [32].  
 
General English procedural rules  
 
The requirement to provide security could not be justified by reference to general English procedural 
rules. Reliance was placed on CPR 3.1(3) and, indirectly, s.70(7) of the 1996 Act [16-21]. However, the  
conditions for recognition and enforcement set out in articles V and VI of the New York Convention 
(to which s.103(2), (3) and (5) give effect ) cons titute a com plete code  intended to establish a common 
international approach. Had it been contemplated that the right to have a decision of a properly arguable 
challenge, on a ground mentioned in article V (i.e. s.103(2) and (3) ), might also be made conditional on 
provision of security in the amount of the award, that could and would have been said. The Convention 
reflects a balancing of interests. Its provisions were not aimed at improving award creditors’ prospects 
of laying hands on assets to satisfy awards. Courts have other means of assisting award creditors which 
do not impinge on award debtors’ rights of challenge, such as  disclosure and freezing orders [41].  
 
Section 70(7) provides that the court may order that any money payable under the award shall be brought  
into court or otherwise secured pending the determination of the application or appeal. It only applies, 
however, to arbitrations that (unlike the present) have their seat in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. 
The 1996 Act contains no equivalent in relat ion to Convention awards. Further, the power will only be 
exercised if the challenge appears flimsy or otherwise lacks substance, which cannot be said of NNPC’s 
fraud challenge [43]. Finally, CPR 3.1(3) has no relevance on this appeal. It is a power, expressed in 
general terms, to impose conditions on orders. Its focus is the imposition of a condition as the price of 
relief sought as a matter of discretion or concession, and not the imposition of a fetter on a person 
exercising its right to  raise a properly arguable challenge to recognition or enforcement  [44].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeals , and refuses the petition  for a permanence order . 
Lord Reed gives  the judgment, with which the rest of the Court agrees.  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The test u nder s.84(5)(c)(ii)  is a factual  threshold test which has  to be met before the court reach es the 
stage of considering whether to make a permanence order  under the other provisions of s.84 . The 
judge is the primary decision maker in determining whether the threshold test has been met, and must 
base his or her determination of that issue on findings of fact. The judge is not exercising a merely 
supervisory jurisdiction over the approach of the local authority.  
 
S.84(5)(c)(ii) is similar to section 31(2) of the Children Act 1989 , which  requires the court to be 
satisfied that the child concerned “is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm” before it can 
make a care order. Both provisions impose a threshold test, requiring  the court to be satisfied o f a 
likelihood. Decisions under s.31(2) of the 1989 Act as to a future likelihood of harm cannot be based 
merely on allegations or suspicions, but on facts which have been established on a balance of 
probabilities ( In re J (Children) Care Proceedings: Thre shold Criteria ) [2013] UKSC 9 ).   
 
The approach in In re J is also applicable to the 2007 Act . The legislation needs to be construed in a 
way which strikes a proper balance between the need to safeguard children and the need to respect 
family life.  The req uirement that residence with the parent was likely to be “seriously detrimental” 
indicates  depriving parents of their parental authority is a serious matter and should only be done if 
strict criteria are satisfied . The inclusion of the word “satisfied” as part of the test indicates that 
suspicions cannot form the basis of the  order (and can be contrasted with  other statutory language 
used where suspicion may be enough). If the court finds that the threshold test is satisfied,  it must 
make clear (1) what the nature of the detriment  is, which the court is satisfied is likely if the child 
resides with the parent, (2) why the court is satisfied that it is likely and (3) why the court is satisfied 
that it is serious. The alleged behaviour about which the local au thority was concerned could only be 
relied on as a basis of a finding that the threshold test was satisfied if the allegations were relevant to 
that issue and if they were proved on the balance of probabilities to be true [19-29].  
 
The approach of the Lor d Ordinary was deficient in a number of respects. He did not determine the 
threshold issue arising under s.84(5)(c)(ii) but approached the case in a supervisory manner considering 
whether the local authority’s concerns about EV’s father were justified. The correct approach would 
have been to consider whether the allegations were relevant to the issue ari sing under s.84(5)(c) (ii). If 
they were , then the Lord Ordinary  should have made a finding of fact on the balance of probabilities 
as to whether the allegat ions were true. If he was unable to make such a finding, he should not then 
take them into account in his consideration of the threshold test . Further, t he Lord Ordinary did not 
refer to the matters which he had a duty to consider under s.84(5)(b). It is n ot clear whether  he had in 
mind the requirement under s.84(4) that the child’s welfare is  paramount, but that is not in any event a 
consideration that would arise until the threshold test under s.84(5)(c)(ii) was satisfied [30-62]. 
 
The application should not be remitted to be decided again by the Inner House , but refused . It is open 
to the local authority to commence fresh proceedings as and when that may be appropriate . Remitting 
the case would require the Inner House to go through nine days’ worth of evi dence which by now is 
somewhat stale and which would not take into account intervening events which may be relevant. This 
is a case where the assessment of the evidence is difficult because of the learning difficulties of the 
parents  and there may be a sig nificant benefit in seeing and hearing the evidence  at first instance  [63-
66].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  S J & J Monk’s  appeal  and restores the determination of the 
Upper Tribunal . Lord Hodge  gives the judgment, with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Before Parliament enacted Schedule 6 to the 1988 Act it had long b een an established principle of 
rating law that property  should be valued as it in fact existed on the materi al day . That principle is 
referred to as  “the reality principle” [12]. The reality  principle continues to be a fundamental principle 
of rating and is manifested in Schedule 6, in particular para 2(6) and (7), which provide that certain 
matters relating to the property , including matters affecting its physical state and the mode or category 
of its occupation , shall be taken to be as they are assumed o n the material day  [14]. 
 
The legislative history shows that the repairing assumption introduced by  para 2(1) (b) of Schedule 6 
did not supplant the reality principle by requiring that the premises are to be assumed to be in a 
reasonable state of repair for  the mode of occupation listed on the rating list, namely as “offices and 
premises” [15]. The Court of Appeal went too far in interpreting that assumption  as displacing the 
reality principle in relation to both the physical state  of the property undergoing  redevelopment and to 
its mode of occupation.  The para 2(1) (b) assumption of reasonable repair at the outset of a 
hypothetical tenancy is not addressing the question of whether the premises were capable of beneficial 
occupation. In the context of a buildin g undergoing redevelopment that is a question that requires to 
be asked first . Therefore, the  repair assumption applies to matters affecting the physical state of the 
property  (para 2(7)(a)) but not to its mode or category of occupation (para 2(7)(b)) [20]. 
 
A valuation office r must assess objectively whether a property is undergoing reconstruction, and 
therefore incapable of beneficial occupation, rather than simply being in a state of disrepair.  In carrying 
out that objective assessment of the physical st ate of the property on the material day, the valuation 
officer can have regard to the programme of works being undertaken on the property. If the works are 
assessed as involving redevelopment, there is no basis for applying the para 2(1)(b) assumption to 
override the reality principle and to create a hypothetical tenancy of the previously existing property in 
a reasonable state of repair. This is both because a building under redevelopment, like a building under 
construction, is incapable of beneficial occu pation and because the hypothetical landlord of a building 
undergoing redevelopment would not normally consider it economic to restore it to its prior use  [23]. 
 
If, during  redevelopment , some part of the property becomes capable of occupation, the para 2( 1)(b) 
assumption might apply to that part , but para 2(1)(b) does not deem the development complete [24]. 
 
There is no statutory bar preventing an application to alter the rating list to reflect the actual state of 
the property undergoing redevelopment [29]. There is also no bar to implementing a proposal to alter 
the description of a property on the rating list from “offices and premises” to “building undergoing 
reconstruction” and consequently to reduce the listed rateable value to a nominal amount if the facts, 
objectively assessed, support that alteration. Furthermore, t here is no basis for the argument that a 
property can be listed as being under reconstruction only once the works have proceeded so far that it 
is no longer economic to undertake repairs t o restore the property to its former state  [31].  
 
On the facts found by the Upper Tribunal, the building  was undergoing reconstruction on 6 January 
2012 and the Upper Tribunal was entitled to alter the rating list to reflect that reality [33].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses AMTF’s  appeal.  Lord Hodge  gives the judgment , with 
which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The aim of the Judgments Regulation is to prevent parallel proceedings between courts of different 
member states and thereby avoid or limit irreconcilable judgments and non -recognition of ju dgments 
[11]. Derogations , including article 5.3,  from the general rule under article 2 which co nfers jurisdiction 
on the court s of the defendant’s domicile must be restrictively interpreted to achieve this aim  [13].  
 
Article 5.3 requires  the court to ide ntify where the relevant harm occurred . That is straightforward in 
this case as, unlike the cases which required the CJEU  to develop special rules, it is possible readily  to 
identify one place where the harm occurred [24]. The raising of the German proceed ings was the 
event which gave rise to the damage for the purposes of article 5.3 [25]. The direct harm which AMTF 
suffered from the alleged tort was the expenditure occasioned by the German proceedings. Thus the 
place where the harmful event occurred was G ermany . Article 5.3 is not concerned with consequential 
loss such as the loss of focus on the appellant’s business in London  [27]. 
 
It would be contrary to CJEU  jurisprudence  for the court to craft a special rule for the tort of inducing 
breach of contract  where the contractual clause which has been breached is an exclusive jurisdiction 
clause [28]. It is the occurrence of the direct and immediate harm which is the connecting factor in 
article 5.3  and which creates the benefits of foreseeability and the sou nd administration of justice. 
Those benefits are not themselves connecting factors and a claimant cannot mere ly invoke  those 
benefits to justify the establishment of a ground of jurisdiction under the Judgments Regulation [29]. 
 
A focus on the accessory na ture of the tort of inducing breach of contract does not assist  [30]. The 
fact that a claim in tort is  connected with a contractual claim has not led the CJEU  to elide the grounds 
of jurisdiction in matters relating to a contract with those in matters rela ting to tort [31]. Nor does t he 
inconvenience of separating the resolution of the contractual claims against the former clients from the 
pursuit of the claims against MMGR  assist  [30]. That inconvenience is the price of achieving the legal 
certainty and fo reseeability which are among the principal aims of the Judgments Regulation [35].  
 
CJEU Reference  
 
The circumstances which have caused the CJEU to develop special rules to interpret article 5.3 in 
order to identify the place where the harmful event occurr ed do not arise in this case, in which there is 
no difficulty in locating where the relevant harm has occurred [38]. Recent CJEU case law does not 
suggest that the court has moved away from the principles and approach underpinning the Judgments 
Regulation [40]. The matter is acte clair and no reference is mandated [43].

The Supreme Court  unanimously allows  the appeal. Lord Carnwath gives the judgment, with which 
the other Justices agree.  
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Court of Appeal’s approach would seem to  require disregarding not just the KBP scheme, but 
also all the policies – past and present – which supported development on this land [35]. The Upper 
Tribunal were clearly entitled to regard the underlyi ng policies as potentially relevant to the prospect of 
development , apart from the KBP scheme.  The assessment of their significan ce in the ‘no-KBP world’  
was pre -eminently a matter for the tribunal, which properly took account of the pattern of 
development  on the ground and the long history of identification of this land for development. Their  
approach did not ignore potential policy objections, and disclosed no error of law [36]. 
 
The Court of Appeal was, however, correct to reject the submission that the tribunal should have 
treated the planning status of the land as conclusively fixed by reference to sections 14 -16 of the 1961 
Act. That the statutory assumptions are not exclusive is confirmed in section 14(3) of the 1961 Act, 
itself. They work only in fav our of a claimant, and do not deprive him of the right to argue for 
prospective value under other provisions or the general law [37]. 
 
It is well -established that the application of the Pointe -Gourde  rule may result in changes to the assumed 
planning statu s of the subject land. Further, there is nothing in section 6 to indicate that a more 
restrictive approach should be applied under the statutory disregards: the tribunal did no more than 
emphasise the difference between the statutory tests when it stated t hat the two stages of the analysis 
should not be “elided” [39]. 
 
It has also long been accepted that application of the general law may produce a result more favourable 
to a claimant than the statutory assumptions: the Law Commission has pointed to the two  Jelson  cases 
as an example of this, where the Pointe -Gourde  rule permitted a broader view of the matter [40]. 
 
It is hope d that the amendments currently before Parliament  in the Neighbourhood Planning Bill  will 
achieve their stated aim of “clarifying the principles and assumptions for the ‘no -scheme’ world” . 
Overall, the tribunal’s application of these complex provisions was exemplary; the appeal should be 
allowed and the award of the tribunal restored [43-44].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeals . Lord Reed gives  the judgment, with which the 
rest of the Court agrees.   
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Secretary of Sta te’s decisio ns on the facts were lawful . The ultimate question in article 8 cases is 
whether  a fair balance has been  struck between the competing public and individual interests involved, 
applying a proportionality test. The Rules and Instructions do not d epart from that position , and are 
compatible with article 8 . The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
It is within the margin of appreciation for the Secretary of State to adopt policies  which set out the 
weight to be attached to the competing considerations  in striking a fair balance , including  that family 
life established while the applicant’s stay in the UK is known to be unlawful or precarious  should be 
given less weight, when balanced against the factors weighing in favour of removal, than family life 
formed by a person law fully present in t he UK  [46-53]. 
 
Although  the requirement of “insurmountable obstacles ” to a continuing relationship  is a stringent test 
to be met, rather than one relevant  factor  to be taken in account, this does  not make it incompatible 
with article 8. The phrase “insurm ountable obstacles” was not defined by the Rules when the present 
cases were considered , but it is reasonable to infer that it was intended to have the same meaning as in 
the jurisprudence of the  European Court of Human Rights. It imposed a stringent test and was to be 
interpreted in a sensible and practical way rather than as referring solely to obstacles which make it 
literally impossible for the family to live together in the applicant’s country of origin . This is consistent 
with the guidance on assessin g insurmountable obstacles contained in the Instructions, and the 
definition of that phrase  introduced subsequently in the Rules, effect ive from 28 July 2014  [42-48]. 
 
The “exceptional circumstances” question is also one that the Secretary of State may leg itimately ask. 
Appendix FM is said to reflect how the balance will be struck under article 8 between the right to 
respect for private and family life, and the legitimate aims listed in article 8(2), s o that if an applicant 
fails to meet the requirements of  the Rules it should only be in genuinely exceptional circumstances 
that refusing them leave and removing them from the UK would breach article 8.  The Instructions 
state th at exceptional does not mean unusual or unique , but means  circumstances in which ref usal 
would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual such that refusal of the application 
would not be proportionate.  This is an application  of a test of proportionality , consistent with the 
references to exceptional circumstances in Eu ropean case law and cannot be regarded as incompatible 
with article 8 [54-60]. 
 
On the facts of each case, there was no basis to challenge the conclusions of the Upper Tribunal judge, 
that no evidence was placed before the Secretary of State from  which the conclusion could be reached 
that there were insurmountable obstacles to each applicant’s relationship continuing in their countries 
of origin. Although in the case of Ms Ikuga the case was considered on  an erroneous basis of fact that 
she was not in a gen uine relationship, the insurmountable obstacles test was bound to fail in any event. 
Further, neither applicant had put forward anything which might constitute exceptional circumstances 
as defined in the Instructions.  There was also an argument, advanced f or the first time on appeal, that 
refusal of leave to remain served no good purpose because the applicants were otherwise certain to be 
granted leave to enter if the application was made from outside the UK. There was nothing to suggest 
that this would be the case for either appellant. [69-74]. 
 
The effect of refusal of leave in the applicants’ cases was not a breach of EU law. The Secretary of 
State’s decision s in these cases  did not compel  an EU citizen to reside out side the EU . These  cases fell 
outside t he situations of dependen cy to which th e Zambrano principle of EU law applies  [61-68].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
Challenge to the validity of the Rules under the Human Rights Act 1998 (‘HRA’)  
The Secretary of State is bound by s 6 HRA to exercise her powe rs under the Immigration Act 
1971 compatibly with the ECHR. In a challenge to the legality o f the Rules as such, as well as to  
their application to individual cases, it is legitimate to follow the  four stage proportionality test to 
decide whether the Secre tary of State has struck a fair balance between the individual and public 
interests, taking into account the relevant factors identified by the European Court of Human 
Rights  (ECtHR)  and the significant weight to be given to the interests of children [52, 56]. 
The general provisions of the Rules envisage a two -stage process, the second involving a fact -
sensitive consideration of any h uman rights issues outside the R ules. The duty of the tribunal 
hearing appeals against any adverse decision of the Secretary  of State is to ensure that the ultimate 
disposal of the application is consistent with the ECHR. This means that  there is no basis for 
challenging the new Rules as such under the HRA  [58, 60] . 
The principle of an MIR  
The fact that the MIR may cause hard ship to many does not render it unlawful [81]. It has the 
legitimate aim of ensuring that the couple do not have recourse to welfare benefits and have 
sufficient resources to play a full part in British life. The income threshold chosen was rationally 
conn ected to this aim [83] and the acceptability in principle of an MIR has been confirmed by the 
ECtHR [86].  
Treatment of children  
The Rules assert that the Secretary of State’s s 55 duty has been taken into account but nothing in 
the relevant section give s direct effect to it [90]. The Instructions in their current form do  not 
adequately fill the gap left by the Rules . They are  defect ive and need  to be amended in line with the 
principles established by the ECtHR. The s 55 duty stands on its own and it shou ld be clear from 
the Rules themselves that it has been taken into account. In this respect the Supreme Court grants 
a declaration that the Rules and the Instructions  are unlawful [92]. 
Treatment of alternative sources of funding  
There are restrictions in  the Rules on taking into account the prospective earnings of the foreign 
spouse or partner or guarantees of third party support  when deciding whether the MIR has been 
met. Although harsh, it is not irrational for the Secretary of State to give priority in  the Rules to 
simplicity of operation and ease of verification [98]. Operation of the same restrictive approach 
outside the Rules is a different matter and inconsistent with the evaluative exercise required by 
article 8. A tribunal on an appeal can judge f or itself the reliability of any alternative sources of 
finance and it makes little sense for decision -makers at an earlier stage to be forced to take a 
narrower approach [98]. In this  respect aspects of the Instructions  require revision to ensure that 
decisions are taken consistent with the duties under the HRA. It will be a matter for the Secretary 
of State to decide if it is more efficient to revise the Rules themselves  to achieve this  [101].  
Appeal by SS  
In the light of the crucial finding by the trib unal that there were insurmountable obstacles to the 
couple living together in DRC, any errors in the tribunal’s judgment did not after this long delay 
require the appeal to be remitted for rehearing. Applying the correct test, the extreme interference 
with family life would not be found to be justified on the facts of SS’s case [106].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Toulson, with whom the oth er Justices 
agree, gives the lead judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The fundamental principle underlying article 5 is the need to protect the individual from arbitrary 
detention, and an essential part of that protection is timely judicial control. Howe ver, article 5 must not 
be interpreted in such a way as would make it impracticable for the police to perform their duty to 
maintain public order and protect the lives and property of others [29]. An appreciation of the reality 
and practical implications i s central to the principle of proportionality embedded in both article 5 and 
in the common law relating to arrest for breach of the peace [30]. The ability of the police to perform 
their duty would be severely hampered if they could not lawfully arrest and  detain a person for a 
relatively short time (too short for it to be practical to take the person before a court) [31]. 
 
The Strasbourg case law on how such a preventative po wer can be accommodated within a rticle 5 is 
not clear and settled  and the Strasbou rg court in Ostendorf  was divided.  Whilst the Supreme Court must 
take into account the Strasbourg  case law, the final decision is  the Court’s [32]. The Court  prefers  the 
view of the minority of the Strasbourg court in Ostendorf  that article 5 (1)(c) is capa ble of applying to  a 
case of detention for preventive purposes followed by early release [33]. It would be perverse if the 
law was such that in order to be lawfully able to detain a person so as to prevent their imminen t 
commission of  an offence, the polic e must harbour a purpose of continuing t he detention, after the 
risk has  passed, until such time as the person could be brought before a court with a view to being 
bound over to keep the peace in the future . This would lengthen the period of detention and place an 
unnecessary burden on police resources [36]. Rather, Lord Toulson reads the  phrase “for the purpose 
of bringing him before t he competent legal authority” as  implicitly dependent on the cause for 
detention continuing long enough for the person to b e brought before the court. Early release from 
detention for preventive purpose will not breach article 5 if the lawfulness of the detention can 
subsequently be challenged and decided by a court [38]. 
 
In respect of article 5(1)(b), the Court  also prefers the view  of the minority in Ostendorf . A general 
obligation not to commit a criminal offence or, in this case, a breach of the peace, is not “an obligation 
prescribed by law” for the purposes of article 5(1)(b) as it is not concrete or specific enough. Suc h a 
general obligation does not acquire the necessary degree of specificity by focusing narrowly on the 
particular facts or by the person concerned being given a reminder of it in specific circumstances. The 
police may be required to take action to prevent  an imminent breach of the peace where there is 
insufficient time to give a warning [27, 40] .

 and that the appellant is entitled to rec eive a survivor’s pension under the scheme. Lord Kerr gives  the 
judgment, with which the other Justices agree .  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The parties are agreed that a survivor’s pension , as a “possession”, falls within the ambit of A1P1 and 
that the appellant, as a surviving unmarried cohabiting partner , enjoys a relevant status for the pur pose 
of article 14  and is in an analogous situation to a surviving married partner or civil partner [44-47]. The 
only issue, therefore, is whether the interference with  the appellant’s right to property has been 
“objectively justified”.  The starting point in assessing justification must be the duty of the state under 
article 14 to “secure” the appellant’s right to equal treatment. The duty to secure rights calls for a mo re 
proactive role than the requirement to respect rights. The question of justification must be assessed 
objectively, but the court should not substitute its view for that of the decision -maker, particularly in 
matters of socio -economic policy [ 49].  
 
Acco rding to DENI, the objective behind the nomination requirement was to establish the existen ce 
of a cohabiting relationship  equivalent to marriage or civil partnership and identify the wishes of the 
scheme member [ 29]. The 2009 Regulations, however, already  require a surviving partner to establish 
that a genuine and subsisting relationship existed , so the nomination requirement adds noth ing to this 
evidential hurdle. T he confirmation of the member’s wishes has no intrinsic value  [31]. Although the 
status of cohabitation is not an immutable characteristic  but a matter of choice , this was not a factor 
that was considered by the decision -maker [ 59]. The desirability of establishing a bright -line rule is also 
of marginal significance in this case, as no thought w as given to the possible difficulties with 
administration that might arise if the nomination procedure was not included and no evidence was 
produced that it would cause significant problems in administering the scheme, particularly as in 
England and Wales it is considered that the nomination procedure is not necessary [ 62]. Given 
DENI’s acceptance that the provision of a survivor benefit engages A1P1 and that the appellant has 
the requisite status to rely on article 14, the objective behind the nomination r equirement must have 
been to eliminate unwarranted differences of treatment between married or civil partner survivors on 
the one hand and unmarried long term partners in a stable relationship on the other [ 34].   
 
When it comes to general measures of econ omic or social strategy, the court will generally respect the 
legislature’s policy choice unless it is “manifestl y without reasonable foundation ” [53-55]. Where a 
conscious, deliberate decision by a government department is taken on the distribution of fin ite 
resources, the need for restraint on the part of a reviewing court is both obvious and principled. But 
where the question of the impact of a particular measure on social and economic matters has not been 
addressed by the government department responsib le for a particular policy choice, the imperative for 
reticence on the part of a court tasked with the duty of reviewing the decision is diminished  [64]. A 
matter is not immune from review purely on account of coming within the realm of social or 
economic policy - it must be shown that a real policy choice was at stake. In the present case, not only 
were socio -economic factors not at the forefront of the decision -making process, but the attempt to 
justify retention of the procedure was characterised by gene ral claims, unsupported by concrete 
evidence and disassociated from the particular circumstances of the appellant’s case [ 65]. There is no 
rational connection between the objective, which was to remove the difference of treatment between a 
longstanding coh abitant and a married or civil partner, and the imposition of the nomination 
requirement and therefore its discriminatory effect cannot be justified [ 67].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The flag protests presented the Police Service of Northern Ireland with enormous, almost im possible 
difficulties  [1]. There can be no suggestion that they failed to treat them with sufficient seriousness .  
This case is not about the sincerity and authenticity of those efforts , it is about whether , corporately,  
the police were sufficiently aware of the full range and scope of the powers available to them [3].   
 
The police have a duty, u nder the general  law, to prevent the commission of offences.  Participating in 
an un -notified parade is a criminal offence  under the 1998 Act  and as such  the police  therefore had the 
power to prevent the parades . The police failed properly to appreciate this, instead believing that they 
only had a power to prevent the commission of general public order offences  [10]. The police were 
not required to form a judgment as  to whether a parade should take place, but they were required to 
decide whether the parade was taking place legally.   
 
Failure to notify a proposed parade strikes at the heart of the effective functioning of the Parades 
Commission and therefore at the su ccessful implementation of the 1998 Act. This Act represented a 
paradigm shift away from the old system where police were drawn into the controversial role of 
deciding which parades should be permitted to take place and under what conditions they should be  
allowed to proceed  [63]. The police failed to recognise that the integrity of the system  depended on 
the enforcement of the requirement to notify an intention to hold a parade [64]. It is the police, not 
the Parades Commission, who have the responsibility  for preventing un -notified parades from taking 
place  [45].   
 
The police mistakenly believed that they were obliged by article 11 of the European Convention on 
Human Rights  (freedom of assembly and association)  to facilitate peaceful protests, even though  they 
thought the protests were  “technically illegal”. To the contrary, they had an inescapable duty to 
prevent, where possible, what were plainly illegal parades from taking place and to protect those whose 
rights under article 8 of the European Conventio n (respect for private life) were in peril of being 
infringed, subject to operational constraints. In general, a decision to disperse a parade or protest 
which has not been lawfully notified will not infringe article 11. There was no warrant for allowing 
article 11 considerations to dete rmine how the parades should be policed [60-62]. 
 
The High Court was therefore right to conclude that the police laboured under a misapprehension as 
to the extent of their powers [70]. The police’s policy did not, however, h ave the intention or the 
effect of undermining the 1998 Act [66]. The police had an operational discretion in deciding how to 
respond to  the parades .  Discussion of what action might have been taken had the police properly 
understood the limits of their po wers is unlikely to was unhelpful [74]. Difficulties in making policing 
decisions should not be underestimated, especially since these frequently require to be made in fraught 
circumstances [76]. The absence of a more proactive approach was not caused by p olice inertia, but by 
a concatenation of unfortunate circumstances , including misunderstanding s about  the powers available 
to them  [77].

The Supreme Court allows Samba’s appeal. The transfer to Samba did not dispose of any rights 
belonging to SICL within the meaning of s. 127. Lord Mance gives the lead judg ment, with which 
Lord Neuberger, Lord Sumption, Lord Collins  and Lord Toulson  agree. Lord Neuberger, Lord 
Sumption and Lord Collins also give separate concurring judgments .  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
At common law, the nature of the interest intended to be created by a trust depends on the law 
governing the trust [17-18]. The lex situs  may treat a disposition of shares to a third party as overriding The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 any interest of the beneficiary in the shares. That does not mean, however, that a common law trust 
cannot or will not exist in respect of those shares  [19-21]. A trust may be created, exist and be 
enforced in respect of assets located in a jurisdiction such as Saudi Arabia, the law of which does not 
recognise trusts in any form  [22-34]. Nothing in the Hague Convention alters  this conclusion, 
unsurprisingly given that one of its aims was to provide for the recognition of trusts in jurisdictions 
which did not themselves know the institution [39-40]. Lord Collins  (with whom Lord Sumption  
agrees  [91]) considers  that the case does not raise the interesting and difficult questions on the Hague 
Convention which were argued at each stage of the proceedings [93-102].  
 
The definition of “property” in s. 436 of the Insolvency Act 1986 is plainly wide enough to embrace 
both equitable proprietary and purely personal interests [42-43; 60; 87]. The question of whether there 
was any “disposition” of the se interests is more difficult. It can be argued that the concept extends to 
misappropriat ion of assets subject to a trust [45-50] or destruction or extinction of an equitable 
interest in such assets, but this is not in context the natural meaning [55]. Where a trust exists, the legal 
and beneficial interests are distinct, and what affects the former does not necessarily affect the latter. 
Where an asset is held on trust, the legal title remains  capable of transfer to a third party, although this 
undoubted disposition may be in breach of trust. But the trust rights, including the right to have the 
legal title held and applied in accordance with the terms of the trust, remain. They are not dispose d of 
and continue to be capable of enforcement. If the trust rights are overridden (or, as Lord Neuberger 
puts it, they are lost or disappear [62]), this is not attributable to the  transfer of the legal title. It is 
because they were protected rights that were always limited and in certain circumstances capable of 
being overridden by virtue of a rule of law governing equitable rights, protecting in particular bona fide 
third party purchase rs for value (equity’s “darling”) [51-52; 83; 89].  
 
Section 127 enables companies in winding up to recover assets legally owned by them by treating the 
disposition as void  (subject to the court’s power to validate the disposition) . It is neither aimed at, nor 
apt to cover, the present situation  [53; 56]. Since  on the assum ed facts Samba gave value in the form 
of the discharge of Mr Al -Sanea’s debt, its liability to restore the shares depends not on s. 127, but on 
whether it is accountable on the basis of notice  [54; 56; 88].  
 
Lord Neuberger considers that the word “disposi tion” may in some circumstances embrace 
destruction or extinction of an interest , notably where there has been a surrender of a lease, contractual 
rights or a life interest  [66-69]. There may also be reasons of policy for concluding that s. 127 applies 
equally in respect of property held for a company by a third party as it does to property which it holds 
in its own name [70]. However, there are important differences between a surrender and the loss of a 
beneficial interest on a transfer of the legal estate  to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice  
which would make it unfair for s. 127 to apply in the latter as well as former case so as to render the 
transaction void . Unlike a person taking a surrender of a lease or contractual rights from a company,  a 
bona fide purchaser for value without notice would , by definition , be unaware of both the company 
(or at least that it had an equitable interest) and of the equitable interest  [74-76].   
 
Lord Sumption notes that the law relating to constructive trusts has achieved a high level of 
development. Its coherence would not be assisted by giving the term “disposition” a meaning 
inconsistent with basic principles governing the creation and recognition of equitable interests, 
founded on a very different balance o f the relevant interests [90].  
 
The parties have 21 days to make submissions on the consequences of these conclusions, in particular 
as to whether the proceedings should be stayed or struck out or remitted to the High Court with a 
view to possible amendme nt to enable them to proceed on an alternative basis  [57; 92; 103].

The Supreme Court by a majority of 8 to 3 dismisses the  Secretary of State’s appeal (Lord Neuberger, Lady 
Hale, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson, Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge in the majority with 
Lord Reed, Lord Carnwath and Lord Hughes dissenting). In a joint judgment of the majority, the Supre me 
Court holds that an Act of Parliament is required to authorise ministers to give Notice of the decision of the 
UK to withdraw from the European Union. Each of the dissenting justices gives a separate judgment.    
 
On the devolution issues, the court una nimously concludes that neither section 1 nor section 75 of the NIA is 
of assistance in this case, and that the Sewel Convention does not give rise to a legally enforceable obligation.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The principal issue  
 
Majority judgment  
 
The Supreme Court considers that the terms of the ECA, which gave effect to the UK’s membership of 
the EU, are inconsistent with the exercise by ministers of any power to withdraw from the EU Treaties 
without authorisation by a prior Act of Parliament  
 
 Section  2 of the ECA authorises a dynamic process by which EU law becomes a source of UK law and 
takes precedence over all domestic sources of UK law, including statutes [60]. So long as the ECA 
remains in force its effect is to constitute EU law as an independen t and overriding source of domestic 
law [65]. It operates as a partial transfer of law -making powers, an assignment of legislative 
competences, by Parliament to EU institutions, unless and until Parliament decides otherwise [67-68].  
 
 It is common ground t hat UK domestic law will change as a result of the UK ceasing to be party to the 
EU treaties and the rights enjoyed by UK residents granted through EU law will be affected [69].  
 
 The Government argues that the 1972 Act does not exclude the power for minis ters to withdraw from 
the EU Treaties, and that section 2 of the Act actually caters for the exercise of such a power as it gives 
effect to EU law only so long as the power of withdrawal is not exercised [75]. However, there is a vital 
difference between v ariations in UK law resulting from changes in EU law, and variations in UK law 
resulting from withdrawal from the EU Treaties. Withdrawal makes a fundamental change to the UK’s 
constitutional arrangements, by cutting off the source of EU law, [78-80]. Such  a fundamental change 
will be the inevitable effect of a Notice being served [81]. The UK constitution requires such changes 
to be effected by Parliamentary legislation [82].   
 
 The fact that withdrawal from the EU would remove some existing domestic right s of UK residents 
also renders it impermissible for the Government to withdraw from the EU Treaties without prior 
Parliamentary authority [83]. 
 
 It would have been open to Parliament when enacting the ECA to authorise ministers to withdraw 
from the EU Treaties, but clear words would have been required; not only are there no such clear 
words, but the provisions of the ECA indicate that ministers do not have such power [87, 88]. 
Withdrawal is not authorise d by section 2, which envisages ministers taking  part in the EU law -making 
proces ses: withdrawing from the EU is doing the opposite [95]. 
 
 The fact that ministers are accountable to Parliament for th eir actions is no answer constitutionally, if 
the power to act does not exist in the first place and where (as the court has been asked to assume) the 
exercise of the power would be irrevocable and pre -empt any Parliamentary action [92].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  Subsequent EU -related legislation and events after 1972, including the introduction of Parliamentary 
controls in relation to decisions made by UK ministers at EU level relating to the competences of the 
EU or its decision -making processes, but not to the giving of notice u nder Article 50(2), are entirely 
consistent with an assumption by Parliament that no power existed to withdraw from the treaties 
without a statute authorising that course [111] .  
 
 The 2016 referendum is of great political significance. However, its legal s ignificance is determined by 
what Parliament included in the statute authorising it, and that statute simply provided for the 
referendum to be held without specifying the consequences. The change in the law required to 
implement the referendum’s outcome mu st be made in the only way permitted by the UK constitution, 
namely by legislation. The Government accepts that the resolution of the House of Commons on 7 
December 2016 calling on ministers to give notice under Article 50 by 31 March 2017 is a political a ct 
which does not affect the issues arising in the appeals [116-124].  
 
Dissenting judgments  
 
 Lord Reed, with whom Lord Carnwath and Lord Hughes agree, considers that the effect which 
Parliament has given to EU law under the ECA is inherently conditional on  the application of the EU 
treaties to the UK and therefore on the UK’s membership of the EU. The ECA does not impose any 
requirement or manifest any intention in respect of the UK’s membership of the EU. It does not 
therefore affect the Crown’s exercise o f prerogative powers in respect of UK membership [177] .  
 
 Lord Carnwath observes  that service of notice under Article 50(2) will not itself change any laws or 
affect any rights but is merely the start of an essentially political process of negotiating and decision -
making within the framework of that article. The Government will be accountable to Parliament for 
those negotiations and the process cannot be completed without the enactment by Parliament of 
primary legislation in some form [259] .  
 
The devolutio n issues  
 
 The devolution Acts were passed by Parliament on the assumption that the UK would be a member of 
the EU, but they do not require the UK to remain a member. Relations with the EU and other foreign 
affairs matters are reserved to UK Government and parliament, not to the devolved institutions. 
Withdrawal from the EU will alter the competence of the devolved institutions, and remove the 
responsibilities to comply with EU law. [129-130].  
 
 In view of the decision of the majority of the Justices that primary legislation is required for the UK to 
withdraw from the EU, it is not necessary for the court to decide if the NIA imposes a discrete 
requirement for such legislation [132] .  
 
 The decisio n to withdraw from the EU is not a function carried out by the Secretary of State for 
Northern Ireland in relation to Northern Ireland within the meaning of section 75 NIA. Moreover, 
section 1 NIA, which gave the people of Northern Ireland the right to det ermine whether to remain 
part of the UK or to become part of a united Ireland, does not regulate any other change in the 
constitutional status of Northern Ireland [133-135].  
 
 As to the application of the Sewel Convention to the decision to withdraw from t he EU given the 
effect on the devolved competences, the Convention operates as a political constraint on the activity of 
the UK Parliament. It therefore plays an important role in the operation of the UK constitution. But 
the policing of its scope and oper ation is not within the constitutional remit of the courts. The devolved 
legislatures do not have a veto on the UK’s decision to withdraw from the EU [136-151].

unjust deny mr paulley damage reference square bracket paragraph judgment,"  
The Supreme Court  unanimously allows  Mr Pau lley’s appeal , albeit only to a limited extent.   
Lord Neuberger gives the lead judgment (with which Lord Reed agrees ) allowing the appeal  but only 
to the extent that FirstGroup’s policy requiring a driver to simply request a non -wheelchair user to 
vacate the space without taking any further step s was unjus tified. Where a driver  who has made such a 
request  concludes that a refusal is unreasonable, he or she should consider some further step to 
pressurise the non -wheelchair user to vacate the space, depending on the circumstances. Lord Toulson 
and Lord Sumpti on write concurring judgments.  On the issue of the order to be made, this majority 
declines to uphold an award of damages. Lady Hale, Lord Kerr and Lord Clarke  also allow the appeal 
but they would have restored the order of the Recorder in full , including upholding the award of 
damages.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  REASONS FOR THE DECISION  
Under section 29 of the 2010 Act , as a “public service provider” , FirstGroup must not discriminate 
against a person requiring i ts services by not providing the person with the service , and it must  make 
“reasonable adjustments” to avoid substantial disadvantage  to disabled persons  [20-26].  
The Recorder’s judgment effectively required  a policy that could lead to a non -wheelchair user being 
ordered off the bus [40-45]. The Court of Appeal was right to reject this. An absolute rule that any 
non-wheelchair user must vacate t he space would be unreasonable : there are many circumstances in 
which it could be unreasonable to expect a non -wheelchair user to vacate a space, and even more, to 
get off the bus , even where  the space is needed by a wheelchair user  [46-48]. Even a  qualified rule (i .e. 
that any non-wheelchair user must vacate if it is reasonable) implemented  through mandatory 
enforcement would be  likely to lead to confrontation with other passengers  (not least where the non -
wheelchair user vacating the space affected other travellers)  and delay [50-51]. Passengers are not 
clearly subject to a statutory obligation  to comply with a policy relating to the use of the space , and 
would not appear to be unde r such an obligation to get off the bus  if they fail to do so  [52].  
Even though the hearing in the Court of Appeal had proceeded on the basis that it was not part of Mr 
Paulley’s case [59], the argument that FirstGroup’s PCP should have gone further than  it did, albeit 
not as far as the Recorder concluded, has more force . FirstGroup cannot be criticised for choosing not 
to express the Notice in more forceful  terms: it  was aimed at  politely requir ing non-wheelchair users to 
vacate the space;  there was  evidence that “directive” notices are a less effective means of 
communicati on with the public;  and the use of specially emphatic language should not determine legal 
liability in this case  [63]. The suggestion  that the Notice should state  that priority of wheel chair users 
“would be enforced” would be false  [64]. However, it was not enough for FirstGroup to instruct its 
drivers simply to request non -wheelchair users to vacate the space and do nothing further if the 
request was rejected. The approach of the driver  must depend upon the circumstances, but where he 
or she  concludes that the refusal is unreasonable, some further step to pressurise the non -wheelchair 
user to move  should be considered , such as  rephrasing the request as a requirement (especially where 
the non-wheelchair user could move elsewhere in the bus) or even  a refusal to drive on for several 
minutes [67]. Lord Toulson agrees [83-85] adding that fresh legislative consideration is desirable [87]. 
Lord Sumption a lso agrees albeit with reservations  [92]. 
So far as damages are concerned, Lord Neuberger (with whom Lords Sumption, Reed and Toulson 
agree) concludes that the Recorder did not specifically consider whether, if FirstGroup had simply 
required its drivers to be more forceful, there was a prospect that it would have made a difference in 
this case. It is therefore not possible to conclude that there would have been a real prospect that such 
an adjustment would have resulted in Mr Paulley not being placed in the disadvantage that he was, and 
so an award of damages is not possible [60-61] . 
Lady Hale, Lord Kerr and Lord Clarke dissent in part. As the Recorder found, it was reasonable to 
expect bus operators to do more than FirstGroup did [102-109]. His judgment did not necessarily 
require ejection of  a passenger who refused to move from the bus  nor did it create an absolute rule  
[106];  [129-131]; [137] . Had the practice suggested by the claimant been in force, there was at least a 
real prospect that Mr Paulley would  likely  have been able to travel [108]; [138] . This being so, it was 
unjust to deny Mr Paulley damages [109] ; [160] .

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 A Crown act of state is a prerogative act of policy in the field of international affairs performed by the 
Crown in the course of its relationship with another  state or its subjects [2]. The principle that there is 
no general defence of state necessity to a claim of wrongdoing by state officials has been established 
since the eighteenth century [ 4]. The early cases , however,  indicat ed tha t there was an exception  in the  
case of acts committed abroad against a foreigner  which were authorised or ratified by the Crown [6]; 
it was also suggested  that this doctrine encompassed  two rules: one of non -justiciability for certain 
prerogative acts of the Crown in sphere of f oreign affairs and a second  providing the Government or 
its servants with a defence to claims arising from acts of state committed abroad [19]. The re is no 
reason to doubt that the first rule exists but the question for the Supreme Court is whether , as the  
Government submits,  the doctrine also provide s a defence to a claim which is otherwise  suitable for 
adjudication for a court  [22].  
 
If the doctrine is to be confined to a non -justiciability rule, a broader concept of non -justiciability is 
required, which encompass es aspects of the conduct of military operations abroad as well as the high 
policy decision to engage in them . The courts may need to hear evidence and find facts in order to 
determine whether the acts in question fall within this category [33]. But the doctrine  must be 
narrowly confined to a  class of  acts which involve an exercise of sovereign power, inherently 
governmental  in nature , committed abroad, with the prior authority or subsequent ratification of the 
Crown, in the conduct of foreign rela tions of the Crown . The class of acts must be so closely 
connected to that policy to be  necessary in pursuing  it. It extend s at least  to the conduct of military 
operations which are themselves lawful in international law . The Government accepts that it can not 
apply to acts of torture or to the maltreatment of detainees [36-37, 72, 8 1]. On the presently assumed 
facts, the respondents’ detention by Her Majesty’s forces and transfer s out of British custody were 
steps taken pursuant to deliberately formed polic y against persons reasonably suspected to be 
insurgents , in the context and furtherance of foreign military operations during a time of armed 
conflict , and were thus Crow n acts of  state for which the Government cannot be held liable in 
proceedings for comm on law damages  [75, 95]. 
 
Lord Mance considers that the underlying principle of Crown act of state is one of non -justiciability 
(or judicial abstention or restraint) and it creates unnecessary confusion to suggest that it has two 
branches [47]. Lord Sumpti on’s analysis is that Crown act of state does offer a defence, but  he doubts 
whether it helps to treat the doctrine as comprising two rules, and in any event in the present context 
the two rules merge into one  [80]. Lord Neuberger agrees with Lord Sumption  that the doctrine is 
ultimately based on the need for consistency or coherence in the distribution of functions between the 
executive and the judiciary in the United Kingdom’s constitutional arrangements. It is not that a judge 
lacks the information or ex pertise to resolve the issue, but rather that there are certain governmental 
acts which owing to their nature or circumstances are not susceptible to judicial assessment [104].  
 
The doctrin e was not abolished by the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, which prese rved the previous law 
by the proviso in section 2(1) [41]. It is also compatible with the right to a fair trial protected by article 
6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as it is clearly a rule of substantive law rather than a 
procedural bar [45].  
 
The appeal is therefore allowed and a declaration substituted to the effect that, in proceedings in tort 
governed by foreign law, the Government may rely on the doctrine of Crown act of state to preclude 
the court passing judgment on the claim if the cir cumstances are such as stated in paragraphs 36 -37 of 
this judgment  [46].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
State immunity  is based on the sovereign equality of states and international comity [12]. The 
appellants  submit that state immunity covers (under the concept of ‘ind irect impleading’)  cases where 
it is integral to a claim against United Kingdom authorities to prove that foreign officials acted 
contrary to their own laws.   They rely on the concepts of “interests or activities” in Article 6(2)(b) of 
the 2004 UN Conventi on on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property [25].  However, 
the Court concludes that none of those concept s cover s reputational disadvantage that could be 
suffered by foreign states [29, 195 ]. The relevant foreign states will not be affect ed in any legal sense 
by proceedings to which they are not party . The pleas of state immunity fail accordingly  [31, 197].   
 
Lord Mance identifies three types of foreign act of state  rule recognised in current English authority , 
broadly also reflected in t he judgment of Lord Neuberger . The first is a rule of p rivate international 
law, where by a foreign state’s legislation will normally be recognised and treated as valid, so far as it 
affects movable or immovable property within that state’s jurisdiction [35, 135 ]. The second rule 
(taking, without necessarily endorsing current Court of Appeal authority) goes no further than to 
preclude a domestic court from question ing the validity of a  foreign state’s sovereign act in respect of 
property within its jurisdict ion, at least in times of civil disorder [38, 74 -78].  Even if this rule were , 
however,  viewed as extending more generally to acts directed against the person, it would be subject to 
a public policy exception which would permit the allegations of complicit y in torture, unlawful 
detention and enforced rendition in this case to be pursued in the English courts [80, 156 ]. Thirdly, a 
domestic court will treat as non -justiciable – or will refrain from adjudicating on or questioning – 
certain categories of sovere ign act by a foreign state abroad, even if outside the jurisdiction of that 
state [40, 123 ].  Whether an issue is non -justiciable under the third rule falls to be considered on a 
case-by-case basis, having regard to the separation of powers and the soverei gn nature of activities [90-
95].  English law will take into account whether issues of fundamental rights are engaged, including 
liberty, access to justice and freedom from torture [98, 101] . The international relations consequences 
of a court adjudicating  on an issue may also feed into the assessment under the third rule [41]. In this 
case, the circumstances do not lead to a conclusion that the issues are non -justiciable  [96-105, 167-8]. 
 
Lord Neuberger underlines the limits of the foreign act of state doc trine. A public policy exception 
qualifies the first and (so far as it exists) second rules; and, if necessary, also the third rule [157] .   
 
Lord Sumption  identifies in the case law two relevant principles: ‘municipal law act of state’ 
corresponding gener ally with the first two rules of Lord Mance’s framework [228] , and ‘international 
law act of state’  correspond ing generally with Lord Mance’s third rule. Municipal act of state is 
confined to acts done within the territory of the relevant foreign state  [229]. International law act of 
state requires the English courts not to adjudicate on the lawfulness of the extraterritorial acts of 
foreign states in their dealings with other states or the subjects of other states, since these occur on the 
plane of interna tional law [234] .  But t he doctrine does not apply simply because the subject -matter 
may incidentally disclose that a state has acted unlawfully  and it is subject to a further public policy 
exception, potentially applicable in cases of violations of jus co gens under international law  
(fundamental norms from which no derogation is permitted)  and of fundamental human rights [248] . 
 
It is unnecessary to de cide whether : a) the UN Convention against Torture requires any modification 
of the doctrine of foreign ac t of state to give a universal civil remedy for torture  [11(v) (a), 108]; b) Art . 
6 of the European Convention on Human Rights precludes reliance on state immunity or foreign act 
of state ; or to say more  than that the appellants would face difficulties on e ach point [11(v)(b), 281-4].  
 
In the result, state immunity is no bar to the claims, and t he appellants have not , on the assumed facts,  
shown any entitlement to rely on the doctrine  of foreign act of state to defeat the present proceedings. 
The appeals ar e dismissed and the cases may pro ceed to trial.

By a majority of 7 to 2, t he Supreme Court  dismisses Mr Al -Waheed’s appeal, and allows the  
Government’s appeal  in Serdar Mohammed  in part . The majority holds  that British forces had power to take 
and detain prisoners for periods exceeding 96 hours if this was necessary for imperative reasons of 
security, but that its procedures for doing so did not comply with ECHR article 5(4) because they did not 
afford prisoners an effective right to challenge their detention . Lord Sumption  (with whom Lady Hale 
agrees) gives the  lead judgment.  Lord Wilson gives a concurring judgment. Lord Mance adds a mainly 
concurring judgment , as do es Lord Hughes (with whom Lord Neuberger  agree s).  On the issues with 
which he was involved, Lord Toulson agrees with Lord Mance, Lo rd Wilson and Lord Sumption . So far as 
he was involved, Lord Hodge  agrees with Lord Sumption .  Lord Reed (with whom Lord Kerr agrees) 
gives a dissenting judgment  holding that there was authority to detain prisoners for periods exceeding 96 
hours  only in ci rcumstances falling within the grounds specified in article 5(1)  (which would cover the first 
and third periods of detention, but not the second ). 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The first issue the Court addresses is whether British forces had legal power to d etain SM in excess of 96 
hours.  The possible source s for such a power are customary international law and/or the authority of the 
UN Security Council [13]. The majority finds it unnecessary to express a concluded view on whether 
customary international la w sanctions the detention of combatants in a non -international armed conflict  
(“NIAC ”) [14, 113, 148, 224 ]. Lord Reed concludes that no such rule currently exists  as a matter of 
customary international law  [275]. However, the majority holds that authority to capture and detain enemy 
combatants  for imperative reasons of security was implicitly conferred by the relevant Security Council 
resolutions  [30, 119, 164, 224 ]. These were  UNSCR 1546  (2004)  in Iraq [20]; and UNSCR 1386 (2001) in 
respect of Afghanistan  [28, 119]. The majority (other than Lord Mance) further conclude s that individual 
states participating in the International Security Assistance Force (“ISAF”) in Afghanistan w ere not limited 
by ISAF’s policy of restricting detention to 96 hours , so that t he United Kingdom was entitled to adopt its 
own detention policy [38-39]. Lord Mance  considers that the resolutions conferred authority to detain on 
ISAF, not the contributing states [180] , but arrives at the same conclusion as the majority regarding the 
legitimacy of the United Kingdom’s detention policy on the ground that ISAF tacitly accept ed of the UK’s 
adoption of this policy  [39, 188]. 
 
The next question is whether it is possible to reconcile these conclusions under public international law 
with articl e 5 ECHR. The European Court of Human Rights in Hassan v UK  was able to “accommodate” 
the six permitted grounds of detention under article 5 with the power recognised under public 
international law to detain in the course of an international armed conflict  (“IAC”) . The majority holds 
that the same approach applies to a NIAC , where the source of the power to detain is a resolution of the 
Security Council [60, 134-6, 164, 224 ].  The six permitted grounds for detention in article 5(1) ECHR  were 
formulated in r elation to peacetime conditions and could not be regarded as exhaustive in conditions of 
armed conflict. Their object was to “protect the individual from arbitrariness” . This object was achieved i f 
there was a legal basis  for detention and the power to det ain was not exercisable on grounds which were 
unduly broad, opaque or discretionary [63, 93, 164 -167, 224 ]. The procedure governing military arrest in 
Afghanistan was suitably clear and precise to meet the standards of article 5(1) [93, 113, 165 -167, 224] . 
Article 5(1) did n ot therefore prevent a Convention state from acting under the authority conferred by a 
Security Council resolution.    
 
A majority  (Lord Sumption, Lady Hale, Lord Wilson, Lord Hodge, Lord Reed and Lord Kerr) considers 
that t he detention o f SM did not fall within any of the six specified grounds in article 5(1) , during the 
second period of his detention . He was not at any time held pending “extradition” to the Afghan 
authorities , because transfer to the civil authorities within Afghanistan did not constitute an extradition 
within article 5(1)(f) [78, 84, 113, 23 5, 236, 351]. Any period when he was being detained solely for 
intelligence exploitation purposes could not be justified under article 5(1)(c)  [81, 84, 113, 23 5, 236, 351], or 
under t he relevant Security Council resolution . Lord Mance , Lord Hughes and Lord Neuberger consider 
that whether SM’s detention during any period fell within article 5(1)(f), as modified if necessary under The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Hassan , should be remitted for trial [ 202-203, 230]. Lord  Mance would also have remitted for trial the 
question whether article 5(1)(c) justified detention during the second period [202-203].  
 
How ever, a majority (Lord Sumption, Lady Hale, Lord Wilson, Lord Mance, Lord Hughes, Lord 
Neuberger and Lord Toulson) h olds that  there should be remitted for trial issues as to : 
 whether intelligence exploitation was in fact the sole ground for detention during the second 
period or whether imperative reasons of security were not also a concurrent reason , justifying 
detentio n under articl e 5 read with and modified as necessary under Hassan  having regard to the 
relevant Security Council resolution [89, 113, 191 -200 and 223, 224 ], and  
 whether SM’s detention during the third period fell within article 5(1)(c) or was justified by  
imperative reasons of security under article 5 read with and modified as necessary having regard to 
the relevant Security Council resolution [83, 94 -98, 11 1, 113, 204, 224, 23 5]. 
 
The question of article 5(3) compatibility must also be left for trial [83, 94-98, 111, 113, 204, 224, 23 5]. 
 
A majority holds that it is unnecessary for the United Kingdom to establish a right of detention under 
Afghan law in order to rely on article 5 read with and modified as necessary having regard to the relevant 
Security Co uncil resolution [139, 202, 23 3 and 34 3-346]. 
 
Under article 5(4), the minimum standard of protection from arbitrariness equates to that imposed by 
articles 43 and 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention: an impartial body carrying out initial and regular 
reviews in accordance with a fair procedure [68, 134, 205 -206, 224 , 235]. Fairness require d that SM be 
given an effective means of challenging his detention.  A majority ( Lord Sumption, Lady Hale, Lord 
Wilson , Lord Hodge , Lord Reed and Lord Kerr)  holds  that there was a breach of the requirement to 
provide “sufficient guarantees of impartiality and fairness to protect against arbitrariness”  in two respects : 
the procedure lacked independence and it failed to provide for the participation of the detainee [104-106, 
144].  Lord Mance , Lord Hughes and Lord Neuberger consider that in both respects the matter should, as 
the Court of Appeal concluded, be remitted for trial in the light of the views they express [212-218, 227] 
 
The majority all agree that a finding of breac h of the procedural standards required by article 5(4) will not 
necessarily entitle SM to damages. A different review process might well have led to no more than SM 
remaining in UK custody or being transferred slightly to Afghan custody. [110, 113, 219-220, 223, 224, 
232, 235]. 
 
In his dissenti ng judgment, Lord Reed concludes  that the Security Council resolutions cannot be 
interpreted as authorising detention falling outside article 5(1)(a) to (f) of the ECHR [296]. Moreover, 
Hassan v UK  only operates to mo dify article 5 where it is necessary to reconcile it with the Thir d and 
Fourth Geneva Conventions (i.e. not in the case of a NIAC , to which the Geneva Convention s have only 
limited application ). [315-316].  SM’s detention during the second period  was incom patible with article 5 
as it was not for one of the six specified purposes [351]. In any event, it was for a purpose outside the 
scope of the authority granted by UNSCR 1890 ; it does not remain an open question whether it was for 
imperative reasons of secu rity [352-353].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeal  and restores the order of the Upper Tribunal . Lord 
Carnwath gives the lead judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
(i) Indirect service  
 
The means of service prescribed by the statute are not exclusive. Under ordinary principles the real 
issue is whether the council caused the notice to be received by UKI [36]. Regarding the interposition 
of a third party, in the form of the Eco receptionist, it is unnecessary and unrealistic to introduce 
concepts of agency or statutory delegation. As the Upper tribunal observed, t he Eco receptionist did 
no more than would reasonably be expected of a responsi ble employee in that position. It was the 
natural consequence of the council’s actions [37].  
 
Causation does not depend on control. For example, if a notice is correctly addressed, but mistakenly 
delivered to a neighbour who passes it on to the intended r ecipient, there is no reason why that should 
not be treated as effective service under ordinary principles of causation, even though that neighbour 
was not under the control of either party [38].  
 
Arguments about possible uncertainty are not persuasive, s ince s ome uncertainty in this respect is 
inherent in the legislation, in which neither the methods of service nor the dates of service in different 
circu mstances  are exhaustively defined. Where the date of service is critical, a billing authority may 
choos e a statutory method of service that eliminates or minimises the risk of invalidity  by failure to 
specify the correct date of service. If it chooses a non -statutory method,  it must bear that risk. The risk 
of prejudice to the building owner is limited, as outside the statutory methods service depends on 
actual receipt by the intended recipient [42-43]. 
 
(ii) Electronic communication  
 
Before the enactment of the Electronic Communications Act 2000  (“the 2000 Act”), the state of the 
law was such that service b y fax was valid. T here is no good reason for distinguishing transmission by 
fax from transmission by email as in this case. Parliament must be taken to have legislated against that 
background. The respondent has not been able to indicate any provision of t he 2000 Act that expressly 
or impliedly restricts the previous law, nor an overall inconsistency sufficient to overcome the general 
presumption that Parliament does not intend to change the common law [44-45].  
 
The purpose of the 2000 Act and Orders made under it is to provide a clear and certain basis for the 
routine use of electronic methods by authorities . That purpose is not undermined by a conclusion that 
under general principles, and on the particular facts of this case, the notice was successfully s erved  by 
email . Therefore, the property was correctly brought  into the rating list with effect from 1 June 2012  
[46].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal  and declares that there is no power to impose 
conditions in a CTO wh ich have the effect of depriving a patient of his liberty . Lady  Hale, with whom 
all the other justices agree, gives the only reasoned  judgment.     
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960  1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
CTOs were introduced into the MHA by amendment in 2007, as a new form of order which permitted 
patients to be released into the community subject to conditions which would support their continuing 
treatment  [1]. The statutory regime is set out in ss 17A to 17F. The conditions in a CTO are imposed 
by a patient’s RC  without judicial in put. None of the elaborate provisions in the MHA authorising the 
detention of patients and their recapture if they escape or go absent apply to a community patient. 
There is no power to impose medical treatment on a community patient who has the capacity t o 
consent to it  and does not consent. There are no sanctions for failing to comply with the conditions in 
a CTO, but a  patient may be recalled to hospital if he breaches certain conditions, or if he requires 
medical treatment and there would otherwise be a  risk to his health or safety, or that of others [16]. 
 
The Welsh Ministers argued that as any conditions imposed in a CTO cannot be enforced they cannot 
therefore deprive a patient of his liberty [17]. This is indeed the legal effect of a CTO, but it does not 
mean that a patient has not in fact been deprived of his liberty . The focus is always on his concrete 
situation created by the conditions [18]. The fact that the purpose of the deprivatio n is to enhance 
rather than curtail  the patient’s freedom does n ot affect  this assessment [20-22]. 
 
There is no express power in s 17B(2) to impose conditions which have the effect of depriving a 
community patient of his liberty.  It is a fundamental principle of statutory co nstruction that a power 
expresse d in general words should not be construed to interfere with fundamental rights such as the 
right to liberty of the person [24]. The test for a necessary implication is a strict one and there is no 
reason to suppose that Parliament would have included such a  power in t he MHA had it been thought 
of [26]. A strong indication to the contrary is the fact that CTO conditions cannot compel a patient to 
take his medication [27]; and the lack of detailed rules which the MHA would have provided had 
detention in a place outside h ospital been contemplated [28].  
 
If the MHRT  finds on the facts that a community patient is being dep rived of his liberty , it has no 
power to revoke or vary the conditions. T he question therefore arises as to whether it should exercise 
its only power unde r the MHA to discharge the patient , or whether the patien t must  challenge his 
unlawful detention in an action for  judicial review  [30-32]. This problem is more theoretical than real  
for two reasons . First, although the MHRT has no jurisdiction over the con ditions of treatment and 
detention in hospital, these can be relevant as to whether the statutory criteria for detention are made 
out; and the patient’s actual situation may well be relevant to whether the criteria for the CTO are 
made out . If, however, th e patient needs to challenge his unlawful detention under a CTO other than 
by his right to make periodic applications to the MHRT, his remedy is either habeas corpus or judicial 
review  [33]. Second, a conscientious RC can be expected not to impose conditio ns which this 
judgment makes clear are not permitted in a CTO, and this is reinforced by the duties to provide 
information to a patient and (usually) his nearest relative about the effect of a CTO [34].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Car nwath gives the lead judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Supreme Court held that in most cases, including this one, little is likely to be gained by seeking to 
draw distinctions bet ween the word “unfavourably” in section 15 of the 2010 Act and analogous 
concepts such as “disadvantage” or “detriment” found in other provisions of the Act, or between an 
objective and a “subjective/objective” approach [27].  
 
Passages in the Equality and  Human Rights Commission’s Code of Practice (2011) provide helpful 
guidance as to the relatively low threshold of disadvantage sufficient to trigger the requirement to justify 
under section 15 of the 2010 Act, but they do not overcome the central objection  to Mr Williams’ case 
[27-28].  
 
First, it is necessary to identify the relevant treatment to which section 15 of the 2010 Act is to be 
applied. In this case it was the award of a pension. There is nothing intrinsically unfavourable or 
disadvantageous abou t that . The appellant’s argument depends on an artificial separation between the 
method of calculation and the award to which it gave rise. The only basis on which Mr Williams was 
entitled to any award at this time was by reason of his disabilities. Had he  been able to work full -time, 
the consequence would have been , not an enhanced entitlement , but no immediate right to a pension at 
all. In those circumstances the award was not in any sense “unfavourable”, nor (applying the approach 
of the Code) could it reasonably have been so regarded  [28].

bracket paragraph judgment,"  
The Supreme Court gives a unanimous judgment. It finds  that the whole of the Scott ish Bill would not be 
outside  the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament . However, section 17 would be outside  the 
legislative competence of the Parliament because it would modify the Scotland Act and , at least in par t, the 
sections referred to in the final paragraph below would be outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament 
because they would modify provi sions of the UK Withdrawal Act.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
It is not for this Court to express any view on the  question of which institutions of the UK should exercise the 
legislative powers currently held by EU institutions upon the UK’s withdrawal . Instead, the role of the Court is 
to determine as a matter of law whether , and to what extent , the Scottish Bill wo uld be within the legislative 
competence of the Scottish Parliament  [11].  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/18 87 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
Is the Scot tish Bill as a whole outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament?  
The only relevant question is whether the Scottish Bill relates to relations with the  EU (a reserved matter)  [26]. 
To relate to  a reserved matter, a provision  must have more than a loose or consequential connection with it  
[27]. The Scottish Bill does not relate to relations with the EU . It simply regulates certain of the legal 
consequence s of the cessation of EU law as a source of domestic law  [33].  
 
Is section 17 of the Scottish Bill outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament?  
Under Schedule 4 to the Scotland Act, the  Scottish Parliament does not have legislative compe tence to modify 
the Scotland Act [42]. An enactment is modified by a later enactment  if it is implicitly amended, disapplied or 
repealed in whole or in part [51]. The UK Parliament has the power to authorise Ministers to make subordinate 
legislation, but t he effect of section 17 would be to make the legal effect of such subordinate legislation 
conditional upon the consent of the Scottish Ministers. The imposition of this condition would be  inconsistent 
with the recognition in section 28(7) of the Scotland A ct that the UK Parliament has unqualified legislative 
power in Scotland. It would therefore have to be treated as impliedly amending (and thus modifying)  section 
28(7)  of the Scotland Act  [52].  
 
Are section 33 of and Schedule 1 to the Scottish Bill outsid e the legislative competence of the 
Scottish Parliament ?  
There is an exception to the rule that the Scottish Parliament does not have legislative competence to modify 
the Scotland Act, which allows the Parliament to repeal any enactment which is spent [69]. ‘Spent’ means that 
the provision has no continuing legal effect [72]. The p rovisions  which section 33 and S chedule 1 would repeal 
will not be spent until the UK’s withdrawal  from the EU  [76]. However, the Scottish Ministers do not have 
power to bring se ction 33 into force until the UK has withdrawn, at which point the provisions to be repealed 
would have become spent [77]. As a result, section 33(1) and S chedule 1 do not breach Schedule 4 to the 
Scotland Act [79].  
 
Are various provisions of the Scottish  Bill outside the legislative competence of the Scottish 
Parliament because  they (i)  are incompatible with EU law , (ii)  modify section 2(1) of the 
European Communities Act 1972  (‘ECA’) , and/or (iii) are contrary to the rule of law?  
None of the provisions which are challenged take legal effect until the provisions of EU law with which they are 
incompatible have ceased to have effect as a consequence of the UK’s withdrawal  from the EU . Without such 
legal effect, there is no incompatibility with EU law and no  modification of section 2(1) of the ECA [84-85]. 
The challenge based on the rule of law is misconceived [86].  
 
Can the Supreme Court  consider the effect of the UK Withdrawal Act in the context of this 
reference?   
Yes, because t he Court’s task  is to decid e whether the Bill would be within the legislative competence of the 
Scottish Parliament if it received  the Royal Assent  at the time of the Court’s decision  [97]. 
 
What is the effect of the UK Withdrawal Act on the legislative competence of the Scottish 
Parliament in relation to the Scottish Bill?   
The UK Withdrawal Act is not a reserved matter but it is protected against modification under Schedule 4 [99]. 
Several pr ovisions of the Scottish Bill  in whole or in part  amount to modifications of the UK Withdra wal Act. 
These are: section 2(2) [101] ; section 5 [102] ; section 7(2)(b) and 7(3) [103-104]; section 8(2) [105] ; section 9A 
[106] ; section 9B [107] ; section 10(2), 10(3)(a) and 10(4)(a) [108-110]; section 11 [111-113]; section 13B, section 
14, section 14A,  section 15, section 16, section 19(1) and section 22 (to the extent that these provisions relate to 
section 11) [114-118, 120-121]; section 26A(6) [122] ; and section 33 a nd Schedule 1 paragraphs 11(a) and 16 
[123-124].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal . Lord Briggs gives the sole  judgment  of the Court .  
 
REASONS FOR THE JU DGMENT  
 
The word “highway” has no single meaning in the law [6]. The default land law position , that the 
conveyance of free hold land automatically involves  the transfer of the entire vertical plane , was not The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 followed in successive statutory provisions deali ng with automatic vesting of highway interests  
formerly in private ownership , as seen in the decision in Tunbridge Wells Corpn v Baird [1896 ] AC 434 
(HL) (“the Baird principle”) [7-8].  
 
The Baird principle provides that such a transfer wa s limited to the road surface, the subsoil 
immediately beneath it and airsp ace sufficient to enable use and enjoyment  by the public  and 
maintenance by the highway authority  [9]. The limits set by the Baird principle reflected concerns 
about expropriation of private propert y without compensation resulting from statutory vesting  [11].  
 
It was , rightly, common ground that the Baird principle applies to section 263 of the 1980 Act, 
replicating  section 226 of the Highways Act 1959  (“the 1959 Act”)  [12]. However, section 265 of the 
1980 Act and its predecessors make provision for the transfer of property and liabilities , as between 
successive highway authorities , of highways designated as trunk road s [13]. The first major property 
transfer scheme was undertaken in relation to new ly designated trunk roads by section 7 of the Trunk 
Roads Act 1936 (“the 1936 Act”)  [15]. Despite differences in language, the substance of section 228 of 
the 1956 Act and section 265 of the 1980 are materially the same as section 7 of the 1936 Act [16-19].   
 
The extent of transfer of highway rights is complicated by the fact that local highway authorities often 
acquire property rights in relation to highways by means other than automatic vesting  under section 
263, such as compulsory purchase and acquisiti on by private treaty and, at times, for non-highway 
purposes [21]. Ownership of airspace above and subsoil below the zone of ordinary use may also be of 
substantial commercial or development value, particularly in urban areas  like Central London  [22].  
 
Disagreeing with the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court decides that the Baird principle does not 
apply to article 2 of the Transfer Order or to section 265 of the 1980 Act , upon which article 2 was 
modelled  [28].  
 
The words “ [t]he highway, in so far as it is vested i n the former highway authority” in article 2 , 
properly construed, mean only that part of the vertical plane relating to a GLA road which was vested 
in the relevant council on the operat ive date, in its capacity as former highway authority , is transferred 
[29].  
 
The Supreme Court disagrees with the Court of Appeal’s reasoning that the word “highway”, used i n 
article 2 and section 265, has  a clear common law meaning – it is not a defined term and its meaning in 
this context is to be found through the almost identical wording of section 265  on trunk roads  [31-33]. 
Given the different ancestry of, and purposes served by, section  263 and section 265 of the 1980 Act, 
the word “highway” used in both provisions cannot be given the same meaning [34-36]. The phrase  
beginning with “in so far as” in section 265(1)(a) of the 1980 Act , and in article 2,  import s the 
ownership capacity limitation [37-39].    
 
The Court’s  approach , like that of the arbitrator,  largely avoids  irrational types of multi -layering on t he 
vertical plane in the sense of different highway authorities owning parts of the vertical plane in the 
same highway [40-43]. Further, expropriation concerns are not well -founded because , generally, the 
transfer of property from one highway authority to another is simply the quid pro quo for relief from 
responsibility for operation and maintenance  [48]. Lastly, there is no  presumption or burden of proof 
as to the extent of  highway rights transferred  [49-50].  
 
This decision does not resolve any issues as to the ownership of the lateral plane  of a highway  [51].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeal , deci ding that ground (f) cannot be invoked . Lord 
Sumption gives the leading judgment, with which Lady Hale , Lady Black and Lord Kitchin agree. Lord 
Briggs gives a concurring judgment, with which Lady Black and Lord Kitchin also agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Sumption  considers g round (f) requires a firm and settled intention to carry out the scheme of 
works  – the landlord’s purpose or motive is immaterial  except  to test whether the intention  required by 
section 30(1)(f) exists  [16]. It is irrelevant  whether a landlord’ s intention is reasonable  or whether 
reasonable changes to the scheme could be made so as to allow the tenan t’s continued possession  [15]. 
 
This appeal does not turn on the landlord’s motive or purpose, nor on an objective assessment of the  
reasonableness of the proposed scheme of works , but on what it is that the landlord must intend if 
ground (f) is to apply  [17]. The reason why the landlord’s approach cannot satisfy ground (f) is not 
merely the conditionality of its intention to do the pr oposed works, but the nature of the condition. 
Ground (f) assumes that the landlord’s intention to demolish or reconstruct the premises is obstructed 
by the tenant’s occupation. This is exemplified by (i) the words “could not reasonably do so without 
obtai ning possession of the holding” in section 30(1)(f) and (ii) section 31A , which precludes  a finding 
that ground (f) has been satisfied if the works can reasonably be carried out by exercising a right of 
entry that the tenant is willing to include in the te rms of the new tenancy [19]. 
 
It follows that the landlord’s intention to carry out the works cannot be conditional on whether the 
tenant chooses to assert his claim to a new tenancy . The  intention to demolish or reconstruct the 
premises must exist indepen dently of the tenant’s statutory claim to a new tenancy [19]. On the facts, 
the tenant’s possession of the premises did not obstruct the landlord’s intended works and the 
landlord did not intend to carry them out if the tenant persuaded the court that the works could 
reasonably be carried out while he remained in possession [19]. The entire value of the proposed 
scheme lies in removing the tenant and not in any benefit to be derived from reconstruction itself [17]. 
 
Although not directly relevant in itself,  the landlord’s  motive or purpose may be evidence of (i) his 
genuine intention to carry out the proposed works and (ii) the conditional character of that intention . 
Similarly, a lack of utility of works may allow an inference as to the conditional characte r of the 
landlord’s intention  [21].      
 
Lord Briggs agrees with Lord Sumption that the appeal should be allowed [24]. He clarifies that the 
Court’s decision does not depart from the rule laid down  by the House of Lords  in Betty’s Cafés Ltd v 
Phillips Fur nishing Stores Ltd (No.1) [1959] AC 20  that whether the landlord had the requisite intention to 
rely on ground (f) falls to be assessed at the time of the hearing, not at any earlier date [25]. 
 
Lord Briggs  explains that examining evidence as to  the landlo rd’s purpose or motive  is likely to be a 
valuable means of testing not merely the genuineness (i.e. honesty) but also the conditionality of the 
landlord’s intention, so as to ascertain whether it is in accordance with the statutory  objective  behind 
section  30(1)(f) [26-31].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal , deciding that the legal burden of disproving 
negligence rests on the carrier , both for  the purpose of article III.2 and article IV.2 of the Hague Rules . 
Lord Sumption gives the  sole judgment, with which all members of the Court agree. The judge’s 
factual findings  are restored  and, given the absence  of evidence on the weight of the paper use d, the 
Court decides that the carrier has failed to discharge its legal burden .    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Hague Rules must be read against the background of the common law rules on bailment [7]. 
There are two fundamental principles in the law of ba ilment: (i) a bailee of goods is only under a 
limited duty to take reasonable care of the goods , but (ii) the bailee nonetheless bears the legal burden 
of proving the absence of negligence [8-9]. A contract of carriage governed by the Hague Rules is a 
contract of bailment for reward, to which the same principles apply, unless excluded by the Rules  [11]. 
 
The Hague Rules do not exclude them. They are only a complete code on matters which they cover 
and thus not exhaustive [15]. In particular, they do not dea l generally with the burden of proof, which 
in accordance with ordinary principles of private international law are matters for the law of the forum  
[15]. As with common law bailment , imposing a duty of care on the carrier by article III.2 of the 
Hague Rul es is consistent with his bearing the burden of disproving negligence [17]. That conclusion 
is reinforced by the relationship between articles III and IV. Article IV covers negligent acts or 
omissions of the carrier which would otherwise constitute breache s of article III.2 . It would be 
incoherent for the law to impose the burden of proving the same fact on the carrier under article IV, 
but on the cargo owner under article III.2  [18]. 
 
As to article IV, it is well established that the exceptions cannot be r elied upon if they were caused to 
operate by the negligence of the carrier  [28, 37] . The carrier must prove facts which show not only 
that an excepted peril existed, but that it was causative of the damage  [37]. This means that the general 
rule is that the  carrier bears the burden of proving that the exception was not caused to operate by the 
carrier’s negligence  [33, 37]. The Supreme Court considers that The “GLENDARROCH ” [1894] P 
226 (CA) is no longer good law [31-33].  
 
In the case of the exception in arti cle IV.2(m) for “inherent vice”, the test is whether the cargo was fit 
to withstand the ordinary incidents of the specified service, and its application can be decided only by 
reference to some assumed standard of care  [39]. The mere propensity of the carg o to emit moisture is 
not inherent vice if reasonable care in linin g the containers would have resulted in the cargo being 
discharged undamaged [39].  
 
The Supreme Court considers that the Court of Appeal was not justified in overturning the judge’s  two 
material  factual findings , since it was not shown that the judge was plainly wrong  [40-42].

The Supreme Court by a majority of 4 to 1 (Lord Hughes dissenting) dismisses MM’s  appeal . It holds 
that the MHA does not p ermit either the FtT or the Secretary of State to order a conditional discharge 
of a restricted patient subject to conditions which amount to detention or a deprivation of liberty.  Lady 
Hale (with whom Lord Kerr, Lady Black, and Lord Lloyd -Jones agree ) gives the main judgment.  
 
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Secretary of State has complete control over the conditions imposed on restricted patients and 
whether the patient should be recalled to hospital. The MHA does not specify what conditions may be 
impose d. In practice , the conditions usually require residence at a stated address and for both clinical 
and social supervision [11-12]. The purpose of conditional discharge is to enable the patient to make a 
safe transition from the institutional setting of a ho spital to the community [14].   
 
The word ‘discharge’ in sections 42(2) and 73(2) MHA, when referring to the conditional discharge of 
restricted patients, must mean actual discharge from the hospital in which the patient is currently 
detained, as he remain s liable to be detained [20]. Although there is nothing in the MHA which 
expressly prohibits a condition which amounts to a detention or deprivation of liberty in another 
setting, t here are compelling reason s not to construe ss 42(2) and 73(2) in this way:  
 
• It is difficult to see why the patient’ s consent would be required for the  exercise of a power to 
impose such a condition, yet all parties agree that consent i s needed [30]. 
• The power to deprive a person of his liberty is an interference with a fundament al right . The 
principle of legality means express language is required . Parliament was not asked to consider 
whether the general terms of ss 42(2) and 73(2) MHA included a power to impose a different 
form of detention, without prescrib ed criteria for such detention or, if imposed by the 
Secretary of State, any procedural safeguards [31]. 
• As a practical matter, there i s always a concern that the patient’s willingness to compl y with the 
proposed condition i s motivated more by his desire to get out of hospital  and that he might 
then withdraw his consent and demand to be released. The patient would not be bound by his 
consent to comply with the condition [32]. 
• Most compellingly, such a power would be contrary to the whole s cheme of the MHA, which 
provides  in det ail for only two forms of detention  (in a place of safety for up to 36 hours, or in 
a hospital), each with associated specific powers to convey a patient there, to detain him and to 
retake him if he absents himself from such detention  without leave. There is no equivalent 
express power to convey a conditionally discharge d restricted patient to the place where he is 
required to live or to detain him there, nor is he liable to be taken into custody and returned 
anywhere unless and until he is recalled to hosp ital by the Secretary of State [33-36]. The fact 
that a conditionally discha rged restricted patient can  apply far less frequently tha n a hospital 
patient to the Ft T for his release indicates that Parliament did not consider that such patients 
might be subj ect to conditions which required the same degree of protection as those deprived 
of their liberty  [37]. 
 
Accordingly, the MHA d oes not permit either the Ft T or the Secretary of State to impose conditions 
amounting to detention or a deprivation of liberty u pon a conditionally discharged restr icted patient 
and MM’s  appeal is dismissed  [38]. 
 
Lord Hughes, dissenting, would have held that the Ft T did have the power, if it considered it right in 
all the circumstance s, to impose conditions on the discharge of a r estricted patient so long as the loss 
of liberty involved was not greater than that already authorised by the hospital and restriction orders . If 
the treatment of the patient had progressed to the point where the nature of the detention could be 
relaxed , it was plainly in the public interest that it should be, and he did not consider that the MHA 
prohibited such arrangements [39-49].

A majority of the  Supreme Court dismisses  the appeal , holding that the EDS scheme does not breach 
Article 14 with Article 5 . Lady Black  gives the  leading judgment , with which Lord Carnwath and Lord 
Hodge agree, save on issues specified in their separate judgments. Lady Hale and Lord Mance both 
give dissenting judgments.      
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
Issue 1 – the status issue  
The C ourt holds by a majority (Lady Black, Lord Hodge, Lady Hale and Lord Mance) that Mr Stott 
had the requisite status for Article 14 [81, 184, 212, 236]. In light of the European Court of Human The Supreme Court of the United Kingd om 
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Rights (‘ECtHR’) decision in Clift v United Kingdom (Application No 7205/07), the Court should depart 
from the decision in R (Clift)  v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] 1 AC 484 . In that case  the 
House of Lords had held that different treatment of a prisoner serving a sentence of 15 years or more 
could not be said to be  on the ground of “other status”  [70].  
For the purposes of determining status, there is no real distinction between Mr Clift as a prisoner 
serving 15 years or more and Mr Stott as a prisoner serving an EDS [79]. Considering  all the relevant 
case law and b earing in mind that grounds within Article 14 are t o be given a generous meaning, the 
difference in treatment of EDS prisoners in relation to early release is a difference within the scope of 
Article 14, on the ground of “other status” [81, 185, 237].  
Lord Carnwath concludes that difference of treatment of EDS prisoners is not attributable to some 
“status” for the purposes of Article 14. He would d ismiss the appeal on that basis  [179] . 
 
Issue 2 (a) – analogous situation  
The C ourt holds by a majority (Lady B lack, Lord Carnwath, Lord Hodge)  that EDS prisoners are not 
in an analogous situation to other prisoners. The various sentencing regimes must  be regarded as 
whole entiti es, each designed for particular circumstances  and characteristics . The differences bet ween 
the sentencing regimes are such that prisoners serving sentences  under different regimes are not in 
analogous situation s [155, 180, 195].  
Lady Hale  and Lord Mance (dissenting) hold  that EDS prisoners are in an analogous situation to other 
prisoners s erving determinate sentences and prisoners serving discretionary life sentences  [214,  239]. 
Lady Hale says that f or all three  categories of prisoner , the most important question from their point 
of view is “when will I get out?” The essence of the right in  question is liberty and for that purpose 
their situations are relevantly similar [214] . 
 
Issue 2 (b) – objective justification  
The C ourt holds by a majority (Lady Black, Lord Carnwath, Lord Hodge) that, if EDS prisoners were 
in an analogous situation, the difference of treatment would be  objectively justified  [155, 180, 201].  
The aim of the EDS pro visions, which includes  public protection, is legitimate  [152] . As to whether 
the EDS scheme is a proportionate means of achieving that aim, the C ourt must consi der each 
sentence as a whole. Within the framework of statutory provisions and sentencing guidelines, t he 
sentencing judge imposes the sentence that best meets the characteristics of the offence and the 
offender. The early release provisions are part of th e chosen sentencing regime  and objective 
justification should be considered in that wider context [154] .  
The EDS is better compared to an indeterminate sentence, rather th an to other types of determinate 
sentence.  Counter -balancing the indeterminate priso ner’s earlier eligibility for parole is the lack of any 
guaranteed end to his incarceration, and the life licence to which he is subjected. This undermines the 
argument that the difference in treatment in relation to early release is disproportionate or un fair [155] . 
The EDS is a separate sentencing regime that is neither arbitrary nor unlawful [200] .  
Lady Hale  and Lord Mance  (dissenting) hold that that there is no justification for insisting that an EDS 
prisoner  stay in prison for two thirds of the custod ial term appropriate to the seriousness of his 
offending, while a discretionary life sentence prisoner, who is likely to be even more dangerous than an 
EDS prisoner, would be considered for release after half of what would have been an appropriate 
determinate sentence [218 – 220, 246, 248 ].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeal . Lord Wilson gives the only judgment.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the Home Secretary to act compatibly with the rights 
contained in the European Convention on Human Rights, including the right under article 8 to respect 
for private and family life . Removing an applicant from the UK may interfere with this right.  
Therefore, if the Home Secretary  refuses a person ’s application for  leave to remain in the UK under 
the rules, he must nevertheless consider whether to grant leave on the basis of their right under article 
8. Article 8  gives  him a limited discretion to determine whether the interference is justified  [4].  
 
Section 117A (2) of the 2002 Act prompts  decision -makers exercising this discretion to have regard to 
the public interest considerations  in section 117B, which include: the maintenance of effective 
immigration controls ; that persons in t he UK can speak English  and are financially independent ; and 
that little weight should be given to a private life established by a person at a time when  they are in the 
UK unlawfully or when  the person’s immigration status is precarious [20-21]. A person’s  immigration 
status in the UK can therefore be precarious even when he or she is lawfully present  here [24]. 
Equally, the concept of “little weight” and the wording of section 117 A(2) give decision -makers a limited 
degree of flexibility to uphold an articl e 8 claim on the basis of the applicant’s right to respect for 
private life , even if it was established when the applicant’s immigration status was precarious [49]. 
 
The Court of Appeal accepted  that Ms Rhuppiah’s own immigration status was precarious, but 
suggested that some immigrants could have  an immigration status which was not precarious  even 
though they did not have indefinite lea ve to remain in the UK. It added  that the concept of 
precariousness might fall to be applied having regard to the person’s  overall circumstances . The 
Supreme Court holds  that the application of the concept of precariousness does not depend on  such a 
subtle evaluation of the overall circumstances as suggested by the Court of Appeal [25, 42].  
 
The European Court of Human Right s (“ECtHR ”) has approached the concept of precariousness in 
the context of the right to family life  by asking whether the family life  was created at a time when the 
parties knew that the immigration status of one of them made its persistence in the host st ate 
precarious  from the outset  [28]. Therefore, it distinguished the situation of an applicant who (though 
not present unlawfully) was no more than tolerated by the host state while it determined her various 
applications for residence perm its and consequen tial appeals , from  that of  “settled migrants”  who had 
formally been granted a right of residence . The Supreme Court has previously addressed this ECtHR  
decision , suggesting that  family life will  be precarious if created when an applicant was here unlawfull y 
or had only a temporary right to remain  in the UK  [34-45].  
 
Section 117B  imports  the concept of precariousness from the ECtHR case law. But the section only 
applies to an  applicant’s private life  [37]. In a case not cited to the Court of Appeal, the Upp er Tribunal 
previously held that a person’s immigration status was precarious for the purpose of section 117B(5) if 
his continued presence in the UK would be dependent upon a further grant of leave [38-39]. The 
Supreme Court now approves  this decision . Everyone who, not being a UK citizen, is present in the 
UK and who has leave to reside here other than to do so indefinitely , has a precarious immigration 
status for the purposes of section 117B(5)  [44]. This ‘bright -line’ interpretation  is consistent  with the 
ECtHR and Supreme Court ’s language  in the decisions referred to above [43]. 
 
The FTT  nonetheless erred in concluding that Ms Rhuppiah was not financially independent within 
the me aning of section 117B(3) . The Supreme Court holds  that “financially indepen dent” in section 
117B(3) mean s “not financially dependent upon the state” . It therefore allows  Ms Rhuppiah’s  appeal [52-58].

A majority of t he Supr eme Court dismisses  the appeal  and allows the cross -appeal. The judge’s 
consequential orders, including his order for monetary compensation for the payment under protest 
for use of the facilities in and after 2012 , are restored . Lord Briggs, with whom Lady Hale, Lor d Kerr 
and Lord Sumption agree, gives the main judgment. Lord Carnwath gives a dissenting judgment .        
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Three main conclusions follow from the contextual factors relevant to construing  the Facilities Grant  
[22-24]. First,  the intention was to confer a property right in the form of an easement [25]. Secondly , 
the grant was of a single comprehensive right to use a complex of facilities  as they evolve d, not fixed in 
1981 [26-29]. Thirdly, there is no express  requir ement  for contri bution to the operational costs [30].  
 
The effect of  In re Ellenborough Park [1956] Ch 131  (CA) – the leading case on easements – on the 
central question in this appeal, namely whether the Facilities Grant could n ot amount to an easement 
because  it confer red recreational and sporting rights, is fully discussed  [44-57]. Lord Briggs concludes 
that Ellenborough Park establishes that such a grant can amount to an easement [48, 52 -53, 59] .   
 
Overall, t he majority  accepts that  the grant of an easement in this c ase was novel , given the greater 
running costs and operational responsibilities , and that there are factors  which tell  against broad 
recognition of rights  over such facilities  as easements [75]-[80]. Ultimately, h owever, the grant of 
purely recreational (i ncluding sporting) rights over land which genuinely accommodate adjacent land 
may be the subject matter of an easement, provided always that they satisfy the four well -settled 
conditions for easements [81]. Where the actual or intended use of the dominant tenement is itself 
recreational, as is the norm for holiday timeshare developments, the “accommodation” condition will 
generally be satisfied by a recreational easement  [81].  
 
Regarding the fourth condition  – whether the right is capable of forming the su bject-matter of a grant  
– other objections based on  an ouster  (the concern in this case being “step -in rights”  of the dominant 
owner ) and mere passivity (the issue being alleged positive duties on the  servient owner)  are not accepted  
by the majority , becau se of concurrent factual findings by the courts below  [60-73].  
 
On the cross -appeal, the majority  holds that the Court of Appeal  was wrong to limit the grant of rights 
to the facilities in existence at the time of the grant in 1981  [85, 92] . The sporting and recreational 
facilities referred to in the Facilities Grant w ere bound to change significantly  over time [26, 86]  and 
the new indoor swimming pool was, once complete , a facility made within the complex [88-92].      
 
Lord Carnwath’s dissenting judgment : 
 
Lord Carnwath considers that the intended enjoyment of the rights granted in this case, particularly as 
to the golf course and swimming pool, cannot be achieved without the active participation of the 
owner of those facilities in their provision, mainte nance and management [95]. Thus, Lord Carnwath 
would not extend the Ellenborough Park principle to a full leisure complex.  He considers that such an 
extension of the law on easements is wrong in principle and not supported by case law [96].

The Supreme Court dismisses  the appeal  and allows the cross -appeal (Lord Mance and Lord Hodge dissenting 
in part on whether there was sufficient disclosure in the specification for Claims 1 and 3) . Lord Sumption gives 
the leading judgment, with which Lord Reed, Lord Hodge and Lord Briggs agree , save on some issues specified 
in the separate judgments of Lord Bri ggs, Lord Hodge and Lord Mance.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Issues  (i) and (iii) – Construction of the claims and amendment/abuse of process:  
 
The court unanimously affirms  (for reasons giv en by Lord Briggs) : (1) the view of both courts that Claim 1 
extends to  all pain and Claim 3 to all neuropathic pain, whether peripheral or central , and (2) Arnold J’s decision 
rejecting Warner -Lambert’s application to amend the Patent  to narrow it  [15(1) , 16 (Lord Sumption) ; 99-106, 
118-120 (Lord Briggs);  181 (Lord Hodge);  195-196 (Lord Mance) ].  
 
Issue (ii) – Sufficiency of disclosure in specification for Claims 1 and 3:  
 
The court holds , by a majority (Lord Sumption, Lord Reed and Lord Briggs), that the disclosure in the 
specification supports the claims in relation to inflammatory pain , but not neuropathic pain , whether peripheral 
or central . Claims 1 and 3 therefore fail for insufficiency. Thus, the appeal is dismissed  and the cross -appeal  
allowed [15(2 ), 43-54].  
 
The majority’s approach  requires the patentee to demonstrat e that the specification discloses some scientific 
reason why  the implied assertion of efficacy in the patent claim may well be  true [36-37]. More than a bare 
assertion or mere possibi lity of therapeutic efficiency  is required , though a priori reasoning (not necessarily  only 
experimental data)  may suffice  [37]. This  respects  the principle t hat the patentee cannot claim a monopoly of 
new use for an existing compound without real  disclos ure [35].   
 
Lord Hodge  (dissenting)  proposes an alternative approach to sufficiency , preferring a lower standard of 
plausibility , and would have dismissed the cross -appeal  [186-190]. Lord Mance  agrees  with Lord Hodge on this 
issue, concluding that the majo rity’s approach imposes too high a threshold [198-201].  
 
Issue (iv) – Correct test for infringement  of patent manufactured for a limited use :  
 
The court unanimously holds that if Claims 1 and 3 had been valid, they would not have been infringed  by 
Actavi s [15(3)] . The reasons for arriving at this agreed  result differ  substantially .  
 
Lord Sumption and Lord Reed consider that the  intention of the alleged infringer , whether subjective or 
objective,  is irrelevant  and that the  sole criterion of infringement i s whether the product as it emerges from the 
manufacturing process, including any labelling or accompanying leaflet, is presented as suitable for the uses 
which enjoy patent protection  – the “outward presentation” test  [15(3) , 71-86]. On the facts of this case, i t is 
not disputed that Lecaent was sold with labels and patient information to the effect that it was for the treatm ent 
of seizure disorders and general anxiety disorder  [8, 15(3)] .  
 
Lord Mance agrees that the test depends on the objective appearan ce and characteristics of the product as it is 
prepared, presented and put on the market, but considers that in rare cases the context may make it obvious that 
these ar e not to be taken at face value  [15(3) ; 218-223].  
 
Lord Briggs  and Lord Hodge prefer th e view of Arnold J that the test is whether the alleged infringer 
subjectively intended to target the patent -protected market  (Arnold J found they had not so intended ) [15(3) ; 
170-177 (Lord Briggs); 193 (Lord Hodge) ].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In deciding which interpretative tools will best assist in ascertaining the meaning of a contract  or trust , 
and the weight to be given to each of the relevant interpre tative tools, English court s must have regard 
to the nature and circumstances of the par ticular instrument  [13].  
 
A pension scheme has several distinctive characteristics which are relevant to the court’s selection of 
the appropriate interpretative tools.  First, it is a formal legal document which has been prepared by 
skilled and specialist legal draftsmen. Secondly, unlike many commercial contracts, it is not the product 
of commercial negotiation between parties who may have conflicting interests and who may conclude 
their agreement under considerable pressure of  time. Thirdly, it is a n instrumen t which is designed to 
operate in the long term, defining people’s rights long after the economic and other circumstances, 
which existed at the time wh en it was signed, may have ceased to exist. Fourthly, the scheme confers 
important rights on parties, the members of the pension scheme, who were not parties to the 
instrument  and who may have joined the scheme many years after it was initiated. Fifthly, m embers of 
a pension scheme may not have easy access to expert legal advice or be able readily to ascertain the 
circumstances which existed when the scheme was established [14]. 
 
In light of these characteristics, it is appropriate for t he C ourt to give weight to textual analysis, by 
concentrating on the words which the draftsman has chosen to use and by attaching less weight to the 
background factual matrix than might be appropriate in certain commercial contracts  [15]. However, 
the emphasis  on textual analysis as an interpretative tool does not derogate from the need both to 
avoid undue technicality and to have regard to the practical consequences of any construction. Such an 
analysis does not involve literalism but includes a purposive cons truction when that is appropriate  [16].  
 
The Court is persuaded that the correct interpretation of the first sentence of the Definition is that 
RPI means “the RPI or any index that replaces the RPI and is adopted by the trustees” [19]. The 
Court reaches  this view for the following eight reasons.  
 
First, the draftsman chose  to use the word “replacement” which does not naturally suggest the 
selection of an alternative to an option which remains available. It is, nonetheless, capable of bearing 
that meaning,  and one must look to the context for guidance  [20]. Secondly, the word order and 
grammatical construction of the phrase “a replacement adopted by the trustees” suggest that the RPI 
must first be replaced and that the trustees adopt the replacement. [21]. Thirdly, the existence of a 
discretion on the part of the trustees and the requirement that the ad option should not prejudice the 
approval of the Commission ers of Inland Revenue  (“CIR”)  do not militate against this view [22]. 
Fourthly, consistency within the rules of the scheme as a whole, and indeed within the Definition 
itself, would suggest that it is the relevant official authority and not the trustees who are to effect the 
replacement in the first sentence of the Definition  [23]. Fifthly, the CIR guidance on approval of 
schemes does not assist because  the draftsman has not chosen to use wording similar to t hat guidance 
in the Definition [25]. Sixthly, the superseded rules do  not assist in interpreting the Definition  [26]. 
Seventhly,  a provision which provides  for the circumstance of the official replacement of a cost of 
living index d oes not lack a rational purpose [27]. Eighthly, while the requirement of indexation by 
reference to the RPI imposes  obligations on Barnardo’s and contribu tes to the pension deficit at a time 
when many see the CPI as a more reliable ind ex for the cost of living, the C ourt must construe the 
rules of the scheme without any preconceptions as to whether a construction should favour the 
sponsoring employer or the  members [28].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal  with the result that Do oneen and Mr Davidson 
are entitled to the payment of compensation. Lord Reed , with whom the rest of the Court agrees,  delivers 
the judgment.    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Mr Mond argued that , regardless of whether or not the trustee knew of all of the assets, a “final 
distribution” can only occur when either all assets are distributed or enough assets  are distributed so as  
to pay all creditors in full . This construction is rejected because it  would have consequences which the 
debtor cannot have intended when granting the deed [ 12].  
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
First, one  could never be certain whether any distribution was in fac t “final” so that the deed would 
potentially be of indeterminate duration. This would be particularly difficult to reconcile with other parts 
of the deed that vest in the trustee assets and income acquired by the debtor during the currency of the 
trust dee d [13].  
 
Second, it  would make it impossible for the debtor or anyone doing business with him to know whether 
or not the debtor has been finally discharged [ 14].  
 
Third, it  would undermine the purpose of the public Register of Insolvencies, where certificates are 
registered under the 1985 Act signifying that a final distribution has been made, as it could no longer be 
relied on as accurate [ 15]. 
 
Lord Reed observes that the outcome of the case is scarcely satisfactory, and notes that the Court raised 
with the parties the question whether the relevant acts of the trustee might be reduced (set aside) if they 
were the result of an error as to the extent of the trust estate . Alth ough the parties were invited to make 
submissions on this, they declined to do so, and it would accordingly  not have been appropriate for the 
Court to consider these matters on this occasion [ 23].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal s. Lord Carnwath gives the sole judgment, with

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
General approach  
The purpose of Part 5A of the 2002 Act is to produce a straightforward set of rules and to reduce the need 
for disc retionary judg ement when taking account of public interest or other factors not directly reflected in 
the wording of the statute. It also presumed  that those rules are intended to be consistent with the general 
principles relating to the “best interests” o f children [15]. 
 
The s pecific provisions  
Rule 276ADE(1)(iv) contains no requirement to consider the criminality or misconduct of a parent as a 
balancing factor  and such a requirement cannot be read in by implication [16]. Section 117B of the 2002 
Act does  not include criminality as a consideration [17]. However, it is inevitably relevant to consider 
where the parents, apart from the relevant provision, are expected to be, as it will normally be reasonable 
for the child to be with them. To that extent the r ecord of the parents may become indirectly material if  it 
leads to the m having to leave  the UK . It is only if  it would not be reasonable for the child to leave with 
them that the provision may give the parents a right to remain [18].  
 
In section 117C of t he 2002 Act , “unduly harsh” introduces a higher hurdle than that of “reasonableness” 
under section 117B. “Unduly” goes beyond a level of “harshness” that may be acceptable or justifiable in 
the relevant context. It does not require a balancing of relative levels of severity of the parent’s offence, 
other than is inherent in the distinction drawn by the section itself regarding length of sentence, and it does 
not r equire  “very compelling reasons” [23]. 
 
The cases  
KO and IT concerned  section 117C of the 2002  Act. In KO the Upper Tribunal judge was wrong to  decide 
that he should take account of the criminality of the parent in applying the “unduly harsh” test [26, 32] . 
However, this did not affect the correctness of his conclusion, as his overall approach seem ed no different 
to that which the Supreme Court accepts as correct [33-36].  
 
In IT the Court of Appeal was wrong to introduce a “compelling reasons” test and to proceed on the basis 
that the assessment of harshness  required the “nature of offending” to be  considered [42]. However, the 
First-tier Tribunal had erred in proceeding on the basis , unsupported by the evidence,  that IT’s child, as a 
British citizen, could not be expected to relocate outside the UK [44]. The Supreme Court confirms the 
order of the Court of Appeal for remittal to the Upper Tribunal [45]. 
 
NS concerned section 117B of the 2002 Act. The parents had falsely claimed to have completed a 
postgraduate course in order to obtain leave to remain [46]. The Upper Tribunal judge’s conclusion , read 
in its full context, did not involve any error of approach. He was entitled to regard the parents’ conduct as 
relevant to the extent that it meant they had to leave the country , and to consider the position of the child 
on that basis  [51].  
 
Pereira concerned rule 276ADE(1)(iv). The Court of Appeal ordered that the case should be remitted to the 
Upper Tribunal for a fresh determination and it did not limit the issues before the tribunal. As AP is now 
aged 19 he is in principle qualified for leave to remai n under rule 276ADE(1)(v)  and so the appeal may be 
disposed of by agreement. If not, it will fall to be considered in accordance with the law stated in this 
judgment. No further order is required  [54-56].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In interpreting an international convention, national courts must look at the objective meaning of the 
words used and the purpose  of the convention as a whole  [14]. Courts in the UK have adopted an 
approach to interpretation which respects the international character of such a document: the 
interpretation should not be rigidly controlled by domestic precedents of antecedent date, but r ather the 
language should be construed on broad principles of general acceptation [15]. In carrying out this tas k, 
the courts can use as aids to interpretation t he travaux préparatoires , the case law of foreign courts on the 
convention  and the writing of jurists , but in  respect of the Athens Convention , such aids do not provide 
assistance  [17-18]. Therefore, the Supreme Court relies on the broad, generally accepted principles of 
interpretation  [19].  
 
The Court does not accept that the words  “suspension  and interruption”  should have a technical 
meaning derived from certain  civil law systems  for the following three reasons  [20]. Firstly , it is not 
appropriate to look to the domestic law of certain civil law systems for a technical meaning of the words 
in an international convention which was  designed to operate in many common law systems as well [21]. 
Second ly, even within civil law systems and mixed legal systems, there was no uniformity in the use of 
the expression “suspension” when the Athens Convention was adopted  [22]. Thirdly, an interpretation  
of article 16(3)  of the Athens Convention a s excluding domestic rules which have the effect of 
postponing the start of a limitation period would give rise to serious anomalies  [28]. The Court therefore 
holds that the words “the grounds of suspension … of limitation periods” are sufficiently wide to  cover 
domestic rules which postpone the start of a limitation period as well as those which stop the clock after 
the limitation period has begun  [30]. 
 
Second, t he Court d oes not accept that the natural meaning of the words “grounds of suspension and 
interruption of limitation periods ” is limited to grounds which give  rise to a break in a period or course 
of events which is already in train . For instance, t he dictionary definition of “suspension” referred to by 
SFC included “postponement” as one of its mea nings , and  “suspension” in the context of prescription 
or limitation has a broader meaning in several legal systems [32]. The Court also holds that it was 
unnecessary for the grounds of limitation in a  domestic limi tation regime to be framed to extend beyond 
their domestic scope so as to cover limitation periods in conventions such as the Athens Convention 
[33]. Therefore,  the existence of a ground in a domestic limitation statute  which  suspends  the limitation 
period s set out in that  statute is sufficient to bring article 16(3)  of the Athens Convention  into operation 
and extend the time bar by one year [33]. 
 
The Court then consider s whether  section 18 of the 1973 Act does  in fact extend the time bar in respect 
of M rs Warner’s claim as guardian.  Firstly , the Court observes  that the 1973 Act does not postpone the 
start of the limitation period . Rather, section  18 of the 1973 Act postpones the expiry date of the 
limitation period: it instructs a court to disregard the ti me during which the pursuer of the action is under 
legal disability  [37]. In any event, the Court does not accept that postponement of the start of a limitation 
period falls outside an international understanding of a “suspension” of limitation periods [37]. 
Second ly, the legal disability reco gnised by section 18 of the 1973  Act has the effect of suspending the 
running of time on the limitation period under the Athens Convention  [38]. Thirdly , that suspension is 
subject to the long  stop of three years, as s et out in article 16(3) of the Athens Convention.  
 
The Court therefore conclude s that Mrs Warner’s claim as her son’s guardian is not time barred by the 
Athens Convention [40]. The Court dismisse s the appeal [41].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appe al, subject to varying  the conditions to delete the 
requirement  of occupation  for a maximum of ten months in each yea r. Lord Lloyd -Jones  gives the sole 
judgment with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Section 64(3)(a)  of the 2004 Ac t indicates that the purpose of the imposition of conditions is to make a 
house reasonably suitable for occupation by not more than the maximum number of households or 
persons specified in the application or decided by the housing authority. Section 67(1)( a) provides that 
a licen ce may include such conditions as the local housing authority considers appropriate for 
regulating all or any of “the management, use and occupation of the house concerned”, and section 
67(2) sets out a non -exhaustive list of permit ted conditions including “conditions imposing restrictions 
or prohibitions on the use or occupation of particular parts of the house by persons occupying it”  [18].  
 
These words in their natural meaning  are sufficiently wide to include the conditions impos ed by the 
Tribunal s and the Court of Appeal [18]. Such a reading is also consistent with the object and purpose 
of the  2004 Act . Elsewhere in Part 2 of the 2004 Act, the manner of occupation and characteristics of 
occupants are considered relevant in conte xts connected with HMOs and housing standards generally 
[20]. The guidance in respect of the 2004 Act also supports the view that the manner of occupation of 
a room and the type of occupant  may have a bearing on the suitability of a particular room for a 
particular use [23]. The Court does not consider  that the conditions in issue introduce an exception 
for a category of persons or a defined set of circumstances [24]. Furthermore, they do not  permit 
occupation at a lower standard [25].  
 
It is therefore  appropriate to have regard to the proposed mode of occupation in considering the 
suitability of accommodation in an HMO [26]. In particular, account should be taken of the proposed 
mode of occupation where it is likely to influence the quality of the accommod ation made available to 
the occupant. However, this does  not permit the application of lower standards than would otherwise 
be applicable [26]. Thus,  the power to impose conditions under sections 64 and 67 of the 2004 Act 
can be used to limit the class of persons for whom the HMO is suitable [27]. 
 
The Court agrees  with the Court of Appeal that the conditions imposed by the Tribunals were 
deficient in that they failed to require any part of the HMO to be available for communal living and 
did not require the  bedrooms other than the attic bedrooms to be let to students . That deficiency was, 
however, cured by the further conditions introduced by the Court of Appeal  [33]. The condition 
limiting the occupation to persons engaged in fu ll-time education is rational  [35] and enforceable  [37]. 
The Court considers , however,  that the requirement limiting occupation to ten months in each year is 
irrational [36]. 
 
Therefore,  subject to the deletion of the requirement of occupation for a maximum of ten months in 
each year , the conditions imposed by the Tribunals and the Court of Appeal  in each case , considered 
cumulatively, were entirely lawful. Accordingly, the Supreme Court  varies the conditions to delete the 
requirement of occupation fo r a maximum of  ten months in each y ear but otherwise dismiss es the 
appeal  [38].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Duty of care  
First, the present case falls squarely within an established category of duty of care: it has long been 
established that such a duty is owed by  those who provide and run a casualty department to persons 
presenting themselves complaining of illness or injury and before they are treated or received into care 
in the hospital’s wards. The duty is to take reasonable care not to cause physical injury t o the patient. In 
the present case, as soon as the appellant  was ‘booked in’ at reception he entered into a relationship with 
the respondent  of patient and health care provider . The scope of this duty of care extends to a duty to 
take reasonable care not t o provide misleading information which may foreseeably cause physical injury 
[16]. 
 
Secondly, the duty of care is owed by the respondent and it is not appropriate to distinguish, in this 
regard, between medical and non -medical staff. The respondent had cha rged its non -medically qualified 
staff with the role of being the first point of contact for persons seeking medical assistance and, as a 
result, with the responsibility for providing accurate information  as to its availability  [17].   
 
Thirdly, the judgments of the majority in the Court of Appeal elide issues of the existence of a duty of 
care and negligent breach of duty.  [21] 
 
Fourthly , observations on the social cost of imposing such a duty of care are misplaced as this is not a 
new head of liabil ity for NHS health trusts and, in any event, the undesirable consequences of imposing 
the duty in question were considerably overstated. The Court  did, however, acknowledge  that the very 
difficult circumstances under which A&E departments operate “may well  prove highly influential in 
many cases when assessing whether there has been a negligent breach of duty” [22]. 
 
Negligent breach of duty  
A receptionist in an A&E  department  is expected to take reasonable care not to provide misleading 
advice as to the ava ilability of medical assistance. The standard required is that of an averagely competent 
and well -informed person performing the function of a receptionist at a department providing 
emergency medical care [25]. Moreover, responding to requests for informat ion as to the usual system 
of operation of the A&E department is well within the area of responsibility of receptionists [26]. The 
two receptionists on duty were aware of the standard procedure, but the appellant was told to sit down 
to wait for up to four  to five hours. That information was incomplete and misleading. The trial judge 
made the finding that it was reasonably foreseeable that a person who believes it may be four to  five 
hours before he will be seen may decide to leave. In light of that finding , the provision of such misleading 
information by a receptionist as to the time within which medical assistance might be available was 
negligent [27].  
 
Causation  
The appellant’s decision to leave was reasonably foreseeable and was made, at least in part, on the basis 
of the misleading information [29]. The trial judge made further finding s of fact that, (1) had the 
appellant been told he would be seen within 30 minutes he would have waited, been seen by a doctor 
and admitted, and (2) had the appe llant suff ered the collapse at 21 :30 whilst at the Mayday Hospital, he 
would have undergone surgery earlier and he would have made a nearly full recovery [30]. Thus, the 
appellant’s departure did not break the chain of causation.

The Supreme Court unanimously  holds that it has jurisdiction to hear an appeal against all aspects of 
the Court of Appeal’s judgment, finding that t he Court of Appeal erred in refusing to make  a reference 
pursuant to the Attorne y General’s notice under paragraph 33.  
 
It grants the appellants permission to appe al and allows their appeal . The Court concludes  that neither 
the SORs nor FETO imposes civil liability on the appellants for the refusal to express a political 
opinion contr ary to their reli gious belief s. 
 
Lady Hale gives the judgment  on the discrimination issues , and Lord Mance that on the jurisdiction 
issues.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The sexual orientation claim  
The district judge found that the appellants did not refuse to fulfil Mr Lee’s order because of his actual 
or perceived sexual orientation. The objection was to the message on the cake, not any personal 
characteristics of the messenger [22], or anyone with whom he was associated  [33-34]. The message 
was not indisso ciable from the sexual orientation of the customer , as support for gay marriage was not 
a proxy for any particular sexual orientation [25]. The benefit of the message accrues not only to gay 
or bisexual people, but to their families and friends and to the wider community who recognise the 
social benefits which such commitment can bring [33]. Thus , there was no discrimination on grounds 
of sexual orientation in this case.  
 
The political beliefs claim  
Protection against direct discrimination on grounds of rel igious belief or political opinion has 
constitutional status in Northern Ireland  [37]. The discrimination has to be on the ground of the 
religion or belief of someone other than the alleged discriminator [43-45]. As the appellants’ objection 
was not to Mr Lee, but to being required to p romote the message on the cake, th e situation was not  
comparable with people being refused jobs or services simply because of their religious faith, but it was 
arguable that the message was indissociable from Mr Lee’ s politic al opinion . It was therefore necessary 
to consider the impact of the McArthurs’ ECHR rights on the meaning and effect of FETO [48]. 
 
Impact of ECHR rights  
The right s to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (article 9) and to freedom of expression 
(article 10) were clearly engaged by this case [49]. They include the right not to be obliged to manifest 
beliefs one does not hold [52]. The McArthurs could not refuse to provide their products to Mr Lee 
because he was a gay man or because he supported gay marriage, but that was different from obliging 
them to supply a cake iced with a message with which they profoundly disagreed [55]. FETO should 
not be read or given effect in such a way as to compel them to do so unless justification was shown, 
and it had not been in this case [56, 62 ]. 
 
Jurisdiction  
The appellants were entitled to appeal to the Supreme Court in relation to FETO notwithstanding 
their election to appeal to the Court of Appeal by way of case sta ted. Although such appeals are usually 
final und er article 61(6) of the County Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1980  (‘article 61(6) ’), there i s 
an exception in section 42(6) Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978 in respect of  decisions involving 
any question as to the validity of measures of the Nor thern Ireland Assembly. FETO  was equivalent to 
such a measure and the appellants did challenge its validity if it failed to protect their  rights.  It was not 
necessary to decide whether this also permi tted the SORs appeal , given  the overlap in the 
circumstance s, because of the  Supreme Court’s  conclusions on t he Attorney General’s references  [63-
71]. 
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The Court of Appeal  had been wrong to reject the  reference request ed by the Attorney General under 
paragraph 33 on the ground the proceedings were concluded . In principle, appeals are against orders 
not judgments and, in this context, it is natural to regard the proceedings as live until a final order is 
issued.  This error had deprived the appellants  of the inevitably different judgment on the question of 
whether th e SORs imposed civil liability on them for the ir refusal to express a political opinion 
contrary to the ir religious beliefs, which would have eventually followed. An appeal to the Supreme 
Court following such a  procedural error was not precluded by article  61(6), which was focused on the 
point of law not on a challenge to the fairness or regularity of the Court of Appeal’s process. Even 
though the error was collateral to the litigation between the appellants and Mr Lee , it would be overly 
technical to deny the appellants the benefit of the proper handling of the reference. An appeal 
therefore lay to the Supreme Court against all aspects of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, including its 
decision  in respect of the alleged d iscrimination under the SORs as well a s under  FETO [76-90].

The Supreme Court by a majority of 4 to 1 (Lord Hodge dissenting) allows the appeal  and makes a 
declaration that s 39A is incompatible with article 14 of the  ECHR read with article 8, insofar as it 
precludes any entitleme nt to WPA  by a surviving unmarried partner of the deceased . Lady Hale, with 
whom Lord Mance, Lord Kerr and Lady Black agree, gives the substantive judgment of the majority.  
Lord Mance, with wh om Lady Hale, Lord Kerr and Lady Black agree, gives a short concurring 
judgment.  Lord Hodge gives a dissenting judgment.    
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Article 14 secures the rights and freedoms of the ECHR without discrimination. It raises four , 
somewhat overlapping,  questions:  
 
Do the circumstances fall within the ambit of one or more of the Convention rights?  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960  1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 A breach of a right is not necessary, but the facts must fall within the ambit of one or more of them. It 
is clear that denial of social security benefits falls  within the ambit  of A1P1  [16]. WPA also f alls within 
article 8 as it is a positive measure by the state demonstrating its respect for family life  [19].   
 
Has there been a difference in treatment between two persons in analogous situations?  
In a decision in 2000 , Shackell v United Kingdom  (App 45851/99), the European Court of Human Rights 
(ECtHR) ruled inadmissible a complaint that a denial of widow’s benefits to unmarried surviving 
partners was  discriminatory, holding that marriage conferred a special sta tus and was diff erent from 
cohabitation. In the present  case, however the releva nt facet of the relationship is  not the public 
commitment but the co -raising of children [26]. The purpose of WPA is to benefit the children.  It 
makes  no difference to the chil dren whether or not the couple were married to one another, but the ir 
treatment i s very different [27]. Lord Mance considers that the reasoning of the ECtHR in Shackell  
failed to address the clear purpose of the widow’s benefits in that case, namely to cat er for the interests 
of any relevant child, and Shackell  should not therefore be followed by the Supreme Court [49].  
 
Is that difference of treatment on the ground of a relevant status?  
It is well established that being unmarried is a status for the purpos e of Article 14 , just as being 
married can be  [31]. 
 
Is there  objective justification for that difference in treatment?  
This question depends on whether it pursues a legitimate aim and whether there is a reasonable 
relationship of proportionality between t he means employed and the aim sought to be achieved [32]. 
The promotion of marriage and civil partnership is a  legitimate aim [36], and WPA is part of a (small) 
package of social security measure s which  privilege s marriage and civil partnership [37]. Howev er, it 
was not a proportionate means of achieving this legitimate aim to deny Ms McLaughlin and her 
children the benefit of Mr Adams’ contributions because they were not ma rried to each other. WPA 
exists because of the  responsibilities of the deceased and the survivor towards the children , and its 
purpose is  to diminish the financial loss caused to families with children by the death of a parent [39]. 
This conclusion is reinforced by the international obligations to safeguard children’s rights, to which 
the UK is party, which i nform the interpretation of the ECHR rights;  and it is noteworthy that  in most 
other member states survivor’s pensions are paid directly to the children irrespective of birth status 
[41]. 
 
Remedy  
The exclusion of all unmarried couples from receipt of WPA will not always amount to unjustified 
discrimination , but it will inevitably do so in a legally significant number of case s, which is sufficient to 
require the court to make  a declaration of incompatibility under s 4(2) of the Human Rig hts Act 1998 . 
It will be for the relevant legislature to decide whether o r how the law should be changed [43].  
 
Lord Hodge, dissenting, would have held that the purpose  of the provision of WPA i s to assist the 
survivor rather than a benefit for bereaved c hildren  [58, 73-78]. The circumstances did not justify 
departing from the consistent line of authority from the ECtHR confirming the difference of status 
between marriage/civil partnership and cohabitation [64], so the s ituations were not analogous [79]. 
Even had they been, the difference in treatment in the provision of a contributory rather than means -
tested benefit, not directed to need, was not manifestly disproportionate, but objectively justified [85-
87].

The Supreme Court  unanimously  dismisses  the appeal . Lord Carnwath gives the judgment with which 
all the other justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The leading  authority on the operation of the ECRC regime is the Supreme Court  decision in R (L) v 
Comr of Police of the Metropolis  [2010] 1 AC 410 (“L’s case”). In L’s case, the ECRC disclosed details of 
alleged inadequate parental supervision by the appli cant of her child. It was held that although article 8 
was engaged, the essential issue was whether the disclosure was a proportionate interference with her 
private life , and that in the particular circumstances of the case, the significance of the informa tion in The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 79 60 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 respect of risk to children outweighed the prejudicial effect of the disclosure on the applicant’s 
employment prospects  [22-29]. 
 
Following the initial hearing before the Supreme Court  in the present case, the court sought more 
detailed information  about the guidance available to chief officers and potential employers as to the 
operation of the ECRC system, and also any evidence about its impact on those affected. The resulting 
picture was not entirely clear or consistent [30-41]. 
 
On the issue of t he proper role of the appellate court in approaching proportionality, Lord Carnwath 
noted that the purpose of the appeal is to enable the reasoning of the lower court to be reviewed and 
errors corrected, not to provide an opportunity for parties to reargue  the same case [57]. The question 
in relation to the standard of review is whether the judge erred in principle or was wrong in reaching 
the conclusion which he did  [61]. To limit intervention to a “significant error of principle”, as the 
Court of Appeal d id, is too narrow an approach  if it is taken as implying that the appellate court has to 
point to a specific principle which has been infringed by the judgment of the court below. The 
decision may be wrong because of an identifiable flaw in the judge’s rea soning which undermines the 
cogency of the conclusion. It is equally clear, however, that it is not enough that the appellate court 
might have arrived at a different evaluation. In the present case, it was sufficient for the Court of 
Appeal to consider whe ther there was any such error or flaw in the judge’s treatment of 
proportionality, and if there was not, there was no obligation for it to make its own assessment [64-
65].  
 
The procedural aspect of the complaint under article 8 is essentially that there w as a lack of 
consultation, and this was rightly rejected for the reasons given by the judge as endorsed by the Court 
of Appeal. The officers were fully aware from the evidence at trial of the nature of AR’s defence, and 
his personal circumstances, and they  were aware and took account of the potential impact on his 
employment prospects. As the judge said, there was no indication of any further information he would 
have wished to advance  [66]. 
 
On the substantive effect of article 8,  Lord Carnwath rejected th e submission that the interference 
involved in the disclosure could not be justified unless the officers were in a position to form a 
positive view of likely guilt , which could not be done without a full appraisal of the evidence at trial. 
He did  not accep t that, as a matter of domestic law or under article 8, it is necessary or appropriate for 
those responsible for an ECRC to conduct a detailed analysis of the evidence at the trial  [67-68].  
 
The judge went no further than to accept, as he was entitled to do, the Chief Constable’s view that the 
information was “not lacking substance” and that the allegations “might be true”. It was a matter for 
him to assess whether the information was of a sufficient wright in the article 8 balance. It should be 
borne in m ind that the information about the charge and acquittal was a matter of public record, and 
might have come to the potential employer’s knowledge from other sources. The judge took full 
account of the possible employment difficulties for AR, but regarded th em as no more than necessary 
to meet the pressing social need for which the ECRC process was enacted  [69-70].  
 
Lord Carnwath notes in  a postscript to his judgment that although he has reached a clear conclusion 
on the limited issues raised by this appeal,  it gives rise to more general concerns about the ECRC 
procedure in similar circumstances. There is no clear guidance as to what weight should be given to an 
acquittal in different circumstance s, and there is a lack of information about how an ECRC is like ly to 
be treated by a potential employer in such a case. Careful thought needs to be given to the value in 
practice of disclosing allegations which have been tested in court and have led to an acquittal [72-76].

It has not been established that the common law or the European Convention on Human Rights 
(ECHR ) give rise to the mandatory requirement to involve the court  to decide  upon the best interest of 
every patient with PDOC  before  CANH can be withdrawn [126] . 
 
The fundamental question facing  a doctor, or a court, considering treatment of a patient who is no t able 
to make his or her own decision i s not whether it is lawful to withdraw or withhold treatment, but 
whether it is lawful to give it. It is lawful to give treatment only if it is in the patient’s best interests. If a 
doctor carries out treatment in th e reasonable belief that it will be in the patient’s best interests, he or 
she will be entitled  to the protection from liability conferred by section 5 of the Mental Capacity Act 
(“MCA”) 2005 [92]. 
 
The starting point  on whether there is a common law  requirement to seek a court order is the House of 
Lords decision in Airedale NHS Trust v  Bland  [1993] A.C. 789 . However, there can be no question of the 
House of Lords in that case having imposed a legal r equirement that in all cases of patients in a pers istent 
vegetative state  an application must be made to court before CANH can be withdrawn. Instead they 
“recommended … as a matter of good practice” that reference be made to the court [93-94]. Therefore, 
when the MCA 2005 came into force in 200 7 there was no universal requirement, at common law, to 
apply for a declaration prior to withdrawing CANH and  the MCA itself did not single out any class of 
decisions which must always be placed before the court  [95]. The MCA  2005 Code of Practice (the 
“Code”) does sp eak of applications to court in cases such as the present but does so in a contradictory 
fashion on the issue of  whether such applications are mandatory [97]. Further, n o requirement to apply 
to court can be found in the post -MCA 2 005 case -law [98]. 
 
The ECHR does not generate a need for an equivalent provision to be introduced [102] . The  European 
Court of Human Rights’  (ECtHR ) decision in Lamber t v France 62 EHRR 2  and subsequent cases ha ve 
repeatedly set out factors relevant to the administering or w ithdrawing of medical treatment . These are 
factors  which the UK has complied with . First, t he UK has a regulatory framework compatible  with the 
requirements of article 2  in the form of the combined effect of the MCA  2005, the Code, and 
professional guidanc e, particularly that of the GMC [105] . Second, the MCA  2005 requires doctors to 
take into account the patient’s express wishes and those of people close to him, as well as the opinions 
of other medical personnel [108] . Third, the opportunity to involve the  court is available whether or not 
a dispute is apparent [109] .  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Lamber t and subsequent decisions show that the ECtHR does not regard it as problematic, in principle, 
that a decision to remove CANH from a patient with PDOC  should be made by a doctor without 
obligatory court involvement [110] . 
 
CANH is medical treatment  and it is not easy to explain, therefore, why i t should be treated differently 
from other forms of life -sustaining treatment [116] . In any event, it is diffi cult to accept that one can 
delineate patients with PDOC  from other patients in such a way as to justify judicial involvement being 
required for the PDOC patients but not the others. In all cases, the medical team make their treatment 
decisions by determin ing what is in the patient’s best interest [119] . 
 
If it transpires that the way forward is finely balanced,  there is a difference of medical opinion, or a lack 
of agreement from persons with an interest in the patient’s welfare, a court application can an d should 
be made [125] .

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 188 6/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
Issue (i)  
Until 1960 the Convention unquestionably applied to the territory now comprised in the SBAs [63]. Treaty 
obligations cease to apply to a territory where it secedes from the state which en tered into the treaty, or 
where a formerly dependent territory becomes independent of the parent state which entered into the 
treaty [64]. The Cyprus Act 1960 did not alter the status of the SBAs but merely excluded them from the 
transfer of territory to t he new Republic of Cyprus when it became independent [69]. As a matter of 
international law t he Convention continues to apply to the SBAs by virtue of the declaration in 1956, in the 
same way it applied to the colony of Cyprus before 1960. Article VII(4) o f the Protocol provides that 
where a state made a declaration under Article 40(1) or (2) of the Convention extending its application to a 
territory for whose international relations it was responsible, and then acceded to the Protocol, the 
declaration shou ld apply to the Protocol also, unless that state notified the Secretary -General to the 
contrary. No further declaration was required to exten d the Protocol to dependent territories where the 
original Convention applied. The UK accede d to the Protocol witho ut any reservation  relating to the SBAs. 
Since the Convention continued to apply to the SBAs after 1960, the Protocol applies there also [71]. 
 
Issue (ii)  
The Convention does not entitle the Respondents to be resettled in the UK  metropolitan territory . A 
state’s duties under the Convention to a refugee reaching a particular territory for whose international 
relations the state is responsible are in principle and in normal circumstances limited to providing and 
securing the refugee’s Convention rights in th at context [89]. The widespread use of colonial clauses  in 
international treaties  reflects the principle that for certain purposes, including the application of treaties, 
dependent territories of a state are treated as having a status in international law distinct from that of the 
parent state’s metropolitan territory [76]. Like many multilateral treaties, the Convention  was framed to 
apply only to a state’s ‘home country’ or ‘metropolitan territory’ unless extended to other territories under 
Article 4 0 [78]. Article 40 suggests that for the purposes of the Convention the metropolitan territory and 
its dependent territories are to be treated as separate units [80]. Similarly, other articles of the Convention 
indicate that the metropolitan territory is to be treated as distinct such as Articles 15, 17 to 24, 26, 19, 32 
and 34 [81-88].  
 
Issue (iii)  
The Respondents’ submission that the 2003 Memorandum was not a proper basis for the provision of the 
support for refugees required by the Convention is rejected [103]. There are uniquely close practical links 
between the SBAs and Cyprus [91-93]. The Convention does refer to the appropriate treatment of refugees 
in a State’s territory and the provision of facilities to refugees there. But nothing in the Convention is  
expressly directed to a situation like that which exists in Cyprus and nothing in it is expressly inconsistent 
with the nature of the arrangements which the UK has made with Cyprus [94]. International courts and 
tribunals will interpret a treaty in line w ith Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. 
They will endeavour to place the factual situation as it has developed since the inception of the treaty 
within the context of the preserved and developing treaty relationship in order to a chieve its object and 
purpose in so far as that is feasible [95]. Subject to issues about the precise interpretation of certain articles, 
the court does not find objection in principle to some , most or all of the supporting facilities required for 
refugees  being provided by co -operative and effective arrangements with the Republic . The more difficult 
issues are as to its application to those already accepted as lawful refugees  [96].  
 
Issues (iv) and (v) have been left for future determination and further s ubmissions . The parties may be able 
to reach agreement without further argument on those issues [104-114]. So far as they remain in dispute the 
appeal should be relisted for further submissions as soon as practicable  [115].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The principle of equivalence requires that the procedu ral rules of member states applicable to claims 
based on EU law are no less favourable than those governing similar domestic claims [3]. The 
principle of equivalence and its qualifying “no most favou rable treatment proviso” (the “ Proviso”)  are 
creations of  the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) jurisprudence and take effect within 
the general context that it is for each member state to establish its own national procedures for the 
vindication of rights conferred by EU law [6]. 
 
The principle of e quivalence requires a true comparator for it to be able to operate at all.  Identification 
of one or more true comparators is therefore the essential first step [7].  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Whether any proposed domestic claim is a true comparator with an EU law claim is context specific  
[9]. The domestic court must focus on the purpose and essential characteristi cs of allegedly similar 
claims [10]. Of particular importance is the specific procedural provision that is alleged to constitute 
less favourable treatment of the EU law c laim. Differences in procedural rules are frequently 
attributable to differences in the underlying claim [11].  
 
It is not necessary or appropriate to treat VAT claims as unique with no possibility of having a true 
comparator. Such a general rule would run  counter to the context -specific basis which underpins the 
principle of equivalence. In Reemsta  Cigarettenfabriken GmbH v Ministero delle Finanze  (Case C -35/05) 
[2007] ECR1 -2452 , the CJEU considered equivalence as a mere fringe issue and , had Reemsta  actua lly 
established such a rule,  this would have provided a simple solution for the question before the CJEU 
in the Littlewood s Retail  Ltd v Revenue & Customs Comrs (Case C -591/10) [2012] STC 1714  [18-21]. 
 
Applying the context -specific analysis , the Court of Appeal was correct to conclude that non e of the 
domestic taxes constituted true comparators with VAT. A trader seeking to appeal a VAT assessment 
is typically in  a significantly different position from  a taxpayer seeking to appeal an assessment to any 
of those other taxes  [22].  
 
VAT’s economic burden falls upon the consumer, but it is collected by the trader from the consumer 
and accounted for by the trader to HMRC.  Taxpayers appealing  Income Tax , for example,  are being 
required to pay something of which t he economic burden falls on them and which they have not 
collected from anyone else. Therefore, it is no less than appropriate that traders assessed to VAT 
should be required to pay or deposit the tax in dispute , which they have or should have collected [23]. 
This logical connection is sufficient to justify the conclusion that VAT is different to those other taxes 
in this context regardless of the  actual  legislative reason for the imposition of the pay -first requirement  
[24].  
 
Lord Briggs considered what t he position would have been had any of Income Tax,  Capital Gains Tax 
or Stamp Duty Land Tax been a true comparator for the purposes of the principle of equivalence. The 
Proviso is not a free -standing rule but part of the expression of the principle of equi valence and is 
directed to the standard of treatment which that principle imposes. Procedures should be broadly as 
favourable as that available for truly comparable domestic claims, rather than the very best available 
[45]. The Proviso’s purpose is to prev ent member states from discriminating against claims based 
upon EU  law by affording them inferior procedural treatment than comparable domestic claims [46]. 
While reaching no final decision on this point, Lord Briggs concluded that t he Court of Appeal’s 
conclusion on this issue is therefore broadly correct [47].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Sumption gives the lead judgment with 
which Lady Ha le and Lords Reed and Briggs agree. Lord Mance gives a concurring judgment.  
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The principle espoused in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd , which permits recovery of 
pure economic loss for a negligent misstatement  wher e a special relationship exists,  is capable of 
further development . However,  voluntary assumption of responsibility remains the foundation of this 
area of law  [7].  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The defendant’s knowledge of the transaction , in respect of which the statement is made , is potentially 
relevant for several reasons . It identifies by name or description the person or group of persons to 
whom the defendant can be said to assume responsibility  [10]. The representor must not only know 
that the statement is likely to be communica ted to and relied upon by someone , it must also be part of 
the statement ’s known purpose that it should be communicated and relied upon by that person if the 
representor is to be taken to assume responsibility to them [11].  
 
Playboy Club argued that the r elationship between BNL and the Club was “equivalent to contract” due 
to Playboy Club ’s status as Burlington’s undisclosed principal. The rule of English law that an 
undisclosed principal may declare himself and enter upon a contract is an anomaly that survives  in 
modern law due to its antiquity rather than its coherence  [12].  
 
It does not follow that simply because a relationship is treated in law as a contractual relationship that 
it is legally the same as a contractual relationship or involves all the s ame legal incidents  [13]. Whether 
a relationship is sufficiently proximate to create a duty of care is a question of fact from which the law 
draws certain conclusions. The liability of a contracting party to an undisclosed princip al is a legal, as 
opposed to factual, construct. It creates contractual relations between parties who do not have a 
factual relationship  with each other . Such a relationship is not necessarily proximate and lacks the 
element of mutual consent required to give rise to an assumption of responsibility  [14]. The majority 
of the principles governing undisclosed principals are entirely inapposite to the law of tort. In 
particular, while the relationship between a contracting party and an undisclosed principal may be 
mutual in a contractua l sense it lacks mutuality in tort  [15]. 
 
BNL had no reason to suppose that Burlington was acting for someone else, and they knew nothing of 
the Playboy Club. It is plain that they did not voluntarily assume any responsibility to the Club  [16].  
 
Lord Manc e writes a concurring judgment. There are passages in some authorities which suggest that 
there are two requirements for a duty of care to arise in respect of a representation:  (a) the claimant 
must  be a specific person or group to whom the responsibility may be said to have been undertaken, 
and (b) the representation must be made specifically in connection with a particular transaction or  
transactions of a particular kind made known to the representor [20]. Lord Mance does not consider 
that this claim shou ld fail for want of communication of the purpose or kind of purpose for which an 
assessment of trustworthiness was required [22]. The claim fails in this case because BNL’s  
representation was direct ed simply and solely to Burlington , who alone objectively requested the 
representation , and not to Playboy Club  [24].

 The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal , answering the certified question in the negative .   
Lord Hughes gives the judgment with which the other justices agree.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 The concept of authorisation of expenses is frequently resorted to in the legislation  [16]. The critical 
question is whether this concept also governs the notional expenditure pr ovision in section 90C of 
RPA 1983 [17] .  
 Section 90C asks, by subsections (1)(a) and (b) , three questions about the  notional  expenditure it is 
considering. If the answer to all of these questions is yes, then  subsection (2) stipulates  that the 
expenditur e shall be treated as incurred by the candidate for the purposes of the Act.  
 The questions, which equally apply to goods, property or facilities, are:   
1. Were the services provided for the use or benefit of the candidat e either free of charge or at  a 
discount of mor e than 10% of commercial value;  
 2. Were they made use of by or on behalf of the candidate ; and The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 w ww.supremecourt.uk  
  
3. If the services had actually been paid for (expenses actually incurred) by or on behalf of the  
candidate, would those expenses be election expenses inc urred by or on his behalf (and thus 
subject to the various controls imposed by the Act)? [18]  
 
There is no room in these questions for an additional requirement that the provision of services must have been authorised by the candidate or his election agent , or by someone authorised by either of 
them. The test is whether the goods, property or facilities are used by, or on behalf of, the candidate. 
This differs from the test  in section 90ZA(4) of RPA 1983 for expenses actually incurred  which does 
require aut horisation. The ambit of the use test is not resolved by the question asked and will depend 
on the facts as they emerge in each case. [19 , 25].   
 Section 90ZA(1) confirms this analysis by the express provision that the definition of election expenses ther ein is subject to section 90C. Rather than 90C incorporating the words of 90ZA(4), it 
imports an additional category of expenditure to be included in 90ZA(4), namely expenses notionally 
incurred by the candidate [20]. 
 The plain reading  of the Act c annot be displaced by possibly inconvenient  or even newly recognised 
consequences [27-28]. The point that the candidate and election agent risk the commission of criminal 
offences is well made. Th e more serious offence of knowi ngly making false declarations requi res a 
dishonest state of mind. While the strict liability offence is differe nt, section 86 of the Act provides for 
relief from sanctions where the offence has been committed despite good faith  [29] .

Hodge and Lady Black agree. Lady Hale and Lord Mance ea ch give a concurring judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
It is important to bear in mind the legal context to this dispute, namely that defended suits for divorce 
are exceedingly rare . While the family court recognises that s.1 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 must 
be conscientiously applied, it takes no satisfaction when obliged to rule that a marriage which has broken 
down must nevertheless continue in being [ 15]. The expectations are that almost every petition under s. 
1(2)(b) will succeed, that the evidence before any contested hearing will be brief, and that the judgment 
The Supreme Court of the United  Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 of the court in such a hearing will almost certainly result in the pronouncement of a decree  [17]. This is 
the background to  the contested hearing in this case, and explains why  Mrs Owens’ advisors agreed to 
a short hearing with no external witnesses  to corroborate her evidence [14-15].   
 
When  applying  s. 1(2)(b) the correct inquiry is : (i) by reference to the allegations of behaviour in the 
petition, to determine what the respo ndent did or did not do; (ii) to assess the effect which the behaviour 
had upon this particular petitioner in light of all the circumstances in which it occurred; and (iii) to make 
an evaluation as to whether, as a result of the respondent’s behaviour and in the light of its effect on the 
petitioner, an expectation that the petitioner should continue to live with the respondent would be 
unreasonable [ 28]. This test has been applied for many years but the application of the test  to the facts 
of an individual  case is likely to change over time, in line with changes in wider social and moral values  
[30-32]. The most relevant change over the past forty years is the recognition of equality between the 
sexes, and of marriage as a partnership of equals [ 34].  
 
At the hearing, the judge gave himself the correct self -direction; he understood he was applying an 
objective test, but with subjective elements [ 39]. The majority nevertheless have concerns about other 
aspects of the judge’s analysis . In particular, they ha ve an uneasy feeling about the summary despatch of 
a suit which was said to depend on a n authoritarian  course of conduct , when the judge had scrutinised  
only a few individual incidents  of Mr Owens’ behaviour  [42]. However, uneasy feelings are of no 
conseque nce in an appellate court. A first -instance judge has many advantages in reaching the relevant 
conclusions , and Mrs Owens’ complaints about the judgment ha ve already been rehearsed and dismissed 
by the Court of Appeal. In such circumstances it is most unli kely for it to be appropriate for the Supreme 
Court to intervene [ 43]. However, the majority invite Parliament to consider replacing a law which denies 
Mrs Owens  a divorce in the present circumstances [ 44-45].  
 
Concurring judgments  
 
Lady Hale agrees with Lord Wilson as to the l egal analysis , but ha s several misgivings about the judge’s 
judgment  [47-48]. Her gravest misgiving relate s to the fact that this was a case which depended upon 
the cumulative effect of a great many small incidents (which were said t o be indicative of authoritarian 
and demeaning conduct over a period of time ), yet the hearing before the judge was not set up or 
conducted in a way which would enable the full flavour of such conduct to be properly evaluated [ 50]. 
In light of her misgivin gs, she considers that the proper disposal is to allow the appeal, and send the case 
back t o the first -instance court t o be tried again . However, this is not a disposal which Mrs Owens is 
actually seek ing, and Lady Hale is therefore reluctantly persuaded that the appeal should be dismissed 
[53-54].  
 
Lord Mance also agrees with Lord Wilson as to the wider legal analysis , however he does not share  the 
concerns expressed by Lord Wilson and Lady Hale about the judge ’s judg ment. Lord Mance consider s 
that the j udge did not misdirect himself at any stage , and that the judge  properly concluded that there 
was nothing in the case overall [ 57, 59]. Moreover, although the hearing of the defended divorce petition 
was listed for a relatively short period , this was how t he judge was invited to decide the matter . It would 
be inappropriate for the Supreme Court to interfere at this stage and say it was not possible in the 
circumstances for the judge to have reached a fair determination [ 58].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Lloyd -Jones  gives the judgment with which 
the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Although p olice officers  have no contract of employment , the officers relied heavily on the analo gy of 
the implied term in employment contracts  of mutual trust and confidence between employer and 
employee  [16]. However, t he Court was not referred to any decided case in any jurisdiction which holds 
that the duty of care for which the officers contend can be derived from this mutual implied term [17]. 
To derive such an obligation would be to move substantially beyond the specific derivative duties 
established in previous cases [18-20]. 
 
The existence of the proposed duty must be established in the tort of negligence  [21]. This is clearly a 
case in which it is sought to extend a duty of care to a new situation . In determining whether such a duty 
should be recognised the law will proceed incrementally and by analogy with previous decisions ( Robinson 
v Chie f Constable of West Yorkshire Police [2018] UKSC 4). The proposed duty will also be tested against 
considerations of legal policy and the coherent development of the law [22-23] 
 
The common law does not usually recognise a duty of care in the tort of negli gence to protect 
reputational interests  [23]. The decision in Calveley v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police [1989] 1 AC 1228 
has an important bearing on the present case. There  it was held that a Chief Constable does not, in 
principle, owe a duty of care to protect the economic and reputational interest s of his officers in respect 
of the prosecution of an investigation or disciplinary proceedings against them. It is therefore di fficult 
to see why a Chief Constable should owe a duty to his officers as to the manner in which he defends a 
claim brought against him by a third party , especially considering that, in such a claim , the Chief 
Constable’s role is essentially responsive to allegations made by the third party  [25-26]. 
 
The fact that the recognition of a duty of care may potentially subject an individual to conflicting duties 
does not necessarily preclude its imposition but in such cases it is necessary to have regard to the 
competing underlying policy considerations [28-29]. The interest s of an employer who is sued on the 
basis that he is vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of his employees differ fundamentally f rom the 
interest of those employees [30]. The possibility  of contribution proceedings between employer and 
employee highlights the potential for conflicts of interests [31]. These stark differences in interest s 
strongly suggest that it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose on an employer a duty of care  to 
defend legal proceedings so as to protect the economic or reputation al interest s of his employee s. It is 
not realistic to suggest that this potential for conflict can be overcome by recognition of a duty of care 
up to the time at which an actual confli ct arises [32]. Moreover, in the context of the present case, the 
Commissioner’s public duties are inconsistent with the imposition of such a duty of care [33]. 
 
Considerations relating to legal policy and the practical conduct of proceedings also weigh heavily against 
the duty for which the officers contend.  For instance,  parties to a dispute should be able to conduct 
litigation in order to resolve their disputes without fear of incur ring liability to third parties [34-38].  
 
Finally, the officers argue that, because both they and the Commissioner had a common interest in the 
outcome of BA’s claim, they would have been able to  rely on common interest privilege in asserting an 
entitlement to  the disclosure of material in the possession of the Commissioner which is privileged 
against disclosure to others. However, the cases show that something more than a shared interest in the 
outcome of litigation is required before common interest privilege can be used in this manner.  Legal  
professional privilege is , ther efore,  a further policy consideration that weighs against the recognition of 
the duty of care for which the officers contend [39-46].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The Supreme Court dismisses HMRC’s appeal on this issue. The CJEU jurisprudence , particularly Cas e 
C-35/11 “FII ECJ II ”, clearly  establishes that the credit for foreign dividends should be by reference to 
the FNR, rather than by reference to the actual or effective tax incurred overseas.  There is no suggestion  
in the CJEU case law  that a ny distinction  is to be drawn i n this respect  between portfolio and non -
portfolio holdings [17-18, 27-28]. As a result of the Court’s conclusion on Issue I , Issue IV (i.e. the 
construction of  the domestic provisions if HMRC  were to  succeed  on Issue I ) does not arise [34].  
 
Issue II: is PAC entitled to compound interest in respect of tax which was levied in breach of EU law, 
on the basis that HMRC were unjustly enriched by the opportunity to use the money in question?  
The Supreme Court allows HMRC’s appeal on this issue. In Sempra Metals Ltd v Inland Revenue Comrs  
[2007] UKHL 34  a majority of the House of Lords held  that a claim would lie in unjust enrichment for 
restitution of compound interest on money which was paid prematurely as the consequence of a mistake  
[43-55]. A number of developments since that decision indicate that it failed to have regard to  tax 
legislation, created  problems  in the law  of limitation , and caused disruption in public finances [56-67].  
Furthermore, it is inconsistent with Investment Trust Companies v Revenue and Customs Comrs  [2017] UKSC 
29, which explained the requirement  for a defective transfer of value by the claimant to the defendant . 
The recipient’s possession of money mistakenly paid to him, and his consequent opportunity to use it, 
is not a distinct transfer of value , additional to the payment of the money . Accordingly, t here is no right 
to interest on the basis of unjust enrichment  [68-74]. The Supreme Court therefore  departs fr om the 
reasoning in Sempra Metals  on this issue  and rejects PAC’s  claims to compound interest (except insofar 
as they were conceded by HMRC) [80]. 
   
Issue III: does a claim in restitution lie to recover lawful ACT which was set against unlawful  mainstream 
corporation tax  (“MCT ”)?2 
The Supreme  Court allows HMRC’s appeal on this issue , answering this question in the negative . When 
the lawful ACT  was set against unlawful MCT , HMRC  did not receive unlawfully levied tax , as required 
for a “San Giorg io” claim  [98].3 If an apparent charge to MCT was unlawful, that charge was a nullity.  
The lawful ACT could not have been set against a nullity , but would remain  available  to be otherwise 
utilised  [101-102].  Further more , the payment of the ACT did not enta il a defective transfer of value 
which fell to be corrected , as required by Investment Trust Companies  (above) [103].  
 
Issue V(a): where ACT from a pool which includes unlawful and lawful ACT is utilised against an 
unlawful MCT  liability, is the unlawful ACT regarded as a pre -payment of the unlawful MCT  liability or 
is the ACT so utilised regarded as partly lawful and unlawful pro rata?  
The Supreme Court allows PAC’s cross -appeal on this issue. Unlawful ACT is treated as set fir st against 
unlawful MCT. Further, b ecause unlawful MCT  is a nullity , the unlawful ACT is recoverable unless it 
has been set against a lawful MCT charge  [111] . 
 
Issue V(b): where domestic FII was carried back to an earlier quarter, is it to be treated as having been 
applied to relieve the lawful and unlawful ACT pro rata, or only lawful ACT?  
The Supreme Court allows PAC’s cross -appeal on this issue.  Domestic FII which is carried back to an 
earlier quarter is to be regarded as having been app lied to relieve only lawful ACT.  HMRC’s pro rata 
approach would deprive a company of the tax credit  at the FNR required under EU law  [118-122].

2 Lawful ACT refers to the element within an ACT charge which did not represent unduly levied tax on overseas -sourced 
dividends. Unlawful MCT refers to the part of the MCT charge which is attributable to the fai lure to give the overseas 
dividends a tax credit at the FNR (pursuant to the Court’s conclusion on Issue I) [88].

The Supreme Court unanimously  allows  the appeal , concluding that the judge was entitled to decline 
to vary the order for periodical payments so as to require the husband to pay all of the wife’s rental 
costs . Lord Wilson gives the judgment with which Lady Hale, Lord Carnwath, Lord Hughes and Lord 
Hodge agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The husband was granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court only on a single ground  -
whether, in light of the fact that provision had already been made for the wife’s housing needs in the 
capital settlement, the Court of Appeal was entitled to interfere with the jud ge’s decision not to 
increase the periodical payments so as to cover all of the wife’s current rental  costs [32].  
 
The Court of Appeal had erred in saying that the judge had given no reason for declining to increase 
the order for periodical payments – the judge had given a clear reason, namely that the wife’s unwise 
decisions in relation to her capital had increased her basic needs  by requiring her to pay rent , and that 
it was consequently unfair to expect the husband to meet these increased needs in full [33].  
 
The Court of Appeal should have considered the impact of the original capital payment on the wife’s 
current need to pay rent, and this involved a consideration of three earlier Court of Appeal authorities: 
Pearce v Pearce  [2003] EWCA Civ 1054, North v North  [2007] EWCA Civ 760, and Yates v Yates  [2012] 
EWCA Civ 532 [ 34-38]. These cases were correctly decided  and in light of this the judge was entitled , 
although not obliged,  to decline to require the husband to fund payment of the rent  in full . This 
respects the wide discretion conferred upon the court under s. 31(1) and (7) of the Matrimonial Causes 
Act 1973 in determining an application for variation of an order for periodical payments . Moreover,  a 
court would need to give very good reasons for requ iring a spouse to fund payment of the other 
spouse’s rent in the circumstances of this case. A spouse may well be obliged to make provision for the 
other spouse, but an obligation to duplicate that provision in situations such as this is improbable  [40].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . It holds that the appellants did not object or 
unequivocally request the immediate return of the children , so there had been  a lawful basis for the 
children’s continued accommodation under s 20 CA. Lady Hale gives the only substantive judgment.     The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Local authorities in England look after  a substantial number of children (over 70,000 in March  2017) , 
either as part of a range of services provided for children in need , or under powers to intervene 
compulsorily to protect children from harm. Compulsory intervention by a local authority requires  the 
sanction of a court process. No court order is r equired for the  authority to provide accommodation 
for children in need under s 20 CA . However, it is subject to the right under s 20(7) for a person with 
parental responsibility for the child, who is willing and able to provide accommodation for him or 
arrange for accommodation for him, to object , and  to the provision in s 20(8) that ‘any person who 
has parental responsibility for a child may at any time remove the child from accommodation provided 
by or on behalf of the local authority under this section’  [1-2]. In short, it is a voluntary service.  
 
If a parent delegates the exercise of his or her parental responsibility for a child to the local authority  
under s 20 CA , such delegation must be real and voluntary. The best way to ensure this is to inform 
the parent fully of their rights under s 20, although delegation can be real and voluntary without being 
‘informed’  [39]. No such delegation is required where  the local authority step s into the breach to 
exercise its  powers under s 20 where there is no -one w ith parental r esponsibility for the child, the child 
is lost or abandoned, or the parent is not offering to look after th e child. In those circumstances active 
delegation is not required [40]. If a parent with unrestricted parental responsibility objects a t any time 
pursuant to s 20(7), the local authority may not accommodate the child under s 20, regardless of the 
suitability of the parent or of the accommodation which the parent wishes to arrange [42-43, 47]. It is 
not a breach of s 20 to keep a child in accommodation for a long period but a local authority must also 
think of the longer term and consider i nitiating  care proceedings in order to fulfil its other duties under 
the CA , and to avoid breaches of the child’s or the pare nts’ rights under article 8 [49-52]. 
 
In the present case, where the s 20 arrangements repl aced the compulsory police protection  under s 46 
without the children returning home in the meantime, the focus was not on the appellants’ delegation 
of parental responsibility  to the Council,  but on their rights under s ubsection s 20(7) and 20(8) [53]. 
Entering into a safeguarding agreement was a matter of good practice , although  it was important that it 
did not give the impression that the parents had no right to object or to remove the childre n [55]. The 
lawfulness of the s 20 accommodation depended on  whether the appellants’ actions amounted to an 
unequivocal request for the children to be returned. The bail conditions were not an insuperable 
impediment to the request and were not a reason to refuse [57]. However, the letters from the 
appellants’ solicitors could not be read as an objection or as a request for immediate return: the  
solicitors were sensibly trying to achieve the return of the children as quickly as possible on a 
collaborative ba sis rather than push the Council into issuing care proceedings [59]. Although the 
Council could have provided earlier support for an application to lift the bail conditions, it was not 
possible to say what effect this would have had, given the independent concerns of the police [60]. 
 
Accordingly , there was a lawful basis for the children’s continued accommodation under s 20 and the 
ground relied on by the judge for finding a breach of the appellants’ article 8 rights was not made out 
[61]. The question of whether the Co uncil’s actions were  a proportionate interference with the right to 
respect for family life throughout the time the children were accommodated was not fully explored in 
the lower courts and was not raised as an issue before the Supreme Court [62]. The appeal is therefore 
dismissed, albeit for reasons which differ from those of the Court of Appeal [63].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Hughes gives the sole judgment with 
which the other justices agree.  
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The appellants relied on the  well-established principle that whenever a  statutory  section  creates a 
criminal offence  but does not refer to the offender’s state of mind  (“mens rea ”), there is a presumption 
that to give effect to the will of Parliament, the court must read in wor ds requiring  mens rea  [8]. 
 
While it is an important principle , it is a principle of statutory construction. It does not empower the 
court to substitute the plain words used by Parliament for a different provision on the grounds that the 
court would have done so  differently by providing for an element, or a greater element, of mens rea  
[9].  
 
The presumption must give way to either the plain meaning of the words of the statute, or to other 
relevant pointers to meaning which clearly demonstrate what was intended. The first port of call for 
any issue of co nstruction is the words of the Act [12].  
 
The words of section 17(b) of the Act suggest an objective test  for mens rea  at first sight. Thus , it is 
very difficult to see this statutory provision as one which is sil ent as to the intent required  for the 
commission of the offence  [13].  
 
An offence of providing funding towards terrorism  first appeared on the statute books in 1976 and 
was re -enacted  in identical form in 1984. Those sections required proof either of know ledge or of 
actual suspicion. However, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989 made a change and introduced the 
words “knowing or having reasonable cause to suspect” in place  of “knowing or suspecting”. These 
changes were deliberate . They are inexplicable unl ess it was the Parliamentary intention to widen the 
scope of the offences to include those who had, objectively assessed, reasonable cause to suspect that 
the money might be put to terrorist use. The change can only have been intended to remove the 
require ment for proof of actual suspicion. The court cannot ignore this clear Parliamentary decision  
[18-19].    
 
It would be an error to suppose that the form of offence -creating words in section 17(b) create  an 
offence of strict liability. Unlike an offence of strict liability, the accused’s state of mind is relevant  for 
section 17(b) . The requirement of an objectively assessed cause for suspicion focuses attention on 
what information the accused had. The requirement is satisfied when, on the information availab le to 
the accused, a reasonable person would suspect that the money might be used for terrorism  [24].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows HMRC’s appeal. Lord Hodge gives the lead judgment with 
which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
HMRC’s principal argument is that the IH erred in holding that a claim for repayment of VAT by an 
individual member of a VAT group must normally be construed as a claim made on behalf of the 
representative member of that group.  HMRC argued that Carlton’s claim was made on its own behalf 
and TCL could not rely on it to avo id the statutory time bar. TCL relied on the reasoning of the  IH and  
argued that , as the representative member, it was entitled to rely on Carlton’s  claims [18]. 
 
The Court notes  that Article 11 of the Principal Directive (like A rticle 4.4 of the Sixth Directive), is 
permissive and is not prescriptive; it does not require member states to institute a single taxable person 
regime and does not lay down a template as to how a member state will treat a group of persons as a 
single tax able person [19]. It is clear from the words in s43(1) of VATA that the UK chose to achieve 
the end which the Principal Directive authorised not by deeming the group to be a quasi -person but by 
treating the representative member as the person which supplie d or received the supply o f goods or 
services.  In UK legislation, t he single taxable pers on is the representative member [21-22]. There is no 
need to complicate matters by introducing a concept of the VAT group as a quasi -persona in an analysis 
of the UK l egislation [26]. Section 43 of VATA does not make the group a taxable person but treats the 
group’s supplies and liabilities as those of the representative member for the time being [27]. 
 
It is clear from s80  of VATA that HMRC’s liability for overpaid output tax is owed to the person who 
accounted to them for VAT . It is also clear that  a claim must be made for the credit or repayment to 
that person before HMRC come s under any liability to credit or repay.  It foll ows from the operation of 
s43 of VATA  that where the representative member has overpaid VAT, the person entitled to submit a 
claim during the currency of a VAT group, unless the claim has been assigned, is either the current 
representative member of the VA T group or a person acting as the representative member’s agent  [29].  
 
The FTT correctly found that Carlton did not make the claims on behalf of TCL. Four reasons supported 
this finding. Firstly, when Carlton made the claims, it had long ceased to be a me mber of the VAT group. 
Secondly, it appears from the 2007 letters that Carlton had already presented claims in relation to its own 
business activities in the period after it had left the VAT group. Thirdly, the use by Carlton of the VAT 
group’s VAT registr ation number was necessary to identify the original source of the allegedly overpaid 
VAT but did not disclose who was entitled to the repayment. Fourthly, in each of the claims submitted 
in 2007, Carlton was claiming repayment of sums paid from 1973, long before its incorporation in 1990, 
as well as in the period after 1990 when it was member of the VAT group. It clarified the basis on which 
it made those claims in its 2009 revised claim. At the time, both Carlton and HMRC would have readily 
understood Carl ton to be claiming repayment in its own interest [34-36]. The 2009 revised claim 
provides relevant and admissible evidence concerning the basis upon which Carlton made the 2007 
claims [37]. 
 
Carlton did not act as TCL’s agent . Carlton had no actual authority to send the letter on TCL’s behalf. 
In any cas e, in circumstances where the UT made its decision on the basis that Carlton had submitted 
the letters on its own behalf, it was not open to an appellate court to find that there  was an agency 
relationship between Carlton and TCL. Furthermore, t here is  also no basis for the argument that TCL 
ratified Carlton’s claims, thereby conferring retrospective authority  upon them . [38-39]. 
 
Finally, TCL applied to the Court to make a refere nce in this case to the Court of Justice of the European 
Union (“CJEU”) but this is ne ither necessary nor appropriate. A  ruling by the CJEU on the nature of 
the single taxable person is not necessary for the determination of this appeal [40-41]. There is a lso no 
inconsistency between schedule 1 of VATA and the Court’s interpretation of s43 of VATA [42].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Sumption gives the lead judgment , with 
which the rest of the Court agrees . An English court is required by article 3 of the Recognition Directive 
to recognise the December decision, and must therefore treat the Oak liability as never having been 
transferred to Novo Banco. Novo Banco was therefore never party to the jurisdiction clause  in the 
facility agreement.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
The provision which is primarily relevant to this appeal is articl e 3 of the Reorganisation Directive , which 
determines the applicable law to be applied to a “reorganisation measure” in England . Article 66 of the 
EBRRD is a more specific provision  which concerns enforcement [22]. Lord Sumption makes two 
points about the Reorganisation Directive, particular ly article 3.  
 
First, its purpose  is to ensure that all assets and liabilities of the institution, regardless of the country in 
which they are situated, are dealt with in a single process in the home member state . This can be achieved 
only by taking the process as a whole and applying the legal effects attaching to it under the law of the 
home state in every other member state. It is not consistent with the language or the purpose of article 
3 that an administrative  act such as the December decision, which affects the operation of a 
“reorganisation measure” under the law of the home state, should have legal consequences as regards a 
credit institution’s debts which are recognised in the home state but not in other me mber states.  [24-
26]. 
 
Second, article 3 does not only give effect to “reorganisation measures” throughout the Union , but  
requires them to be “applied in accordance with the laws, regulations and procedures applicable in the 
home member state, unless other wise provided in this Directive”, and to be “fully effective in accordance 
with the legislation of that member state”.  In this legal scheme, it cannot make sense for the courts of 
another member state to give effect to a “reorganisation measure” but not to  other provisions of the law 
of the home state affecting its operation [27].  
 
For these reasons, Lord Sumption rejects the proposition that the effect of the August decision can be 
recognised without regard to the December decision . It does not matter what the correct analysis of the 
December decision is, provided that it is accepted (as it is) that unless and until it is set aside, it is 
conclusive as a matter of Portuguese law that the Oak liability had never been transferred . It follows 
from the agreed propositions of Portuguese law and from the requirement s of article 3(2)  of the 
Reorganisation Directive that an English court must treat the Oak liability as never having been 
transferred to Novo Banco . Novo Banco was therefore never p arty to t he jurisdiction clause [28]. 
  
Lord Sumption also rejects the Appellants ’ alternative case that , even if the December decision is 
otherwise entitled to recognition in England, it should be disregarded on the ground that it was a 
provisional decision pendin g the final decision of a Portuguese administrative court . As a matter of 
Portuguese  law, the December decision  is binding in Portuguese law  unless and until it is set aside by a 
Portuguese court [31-33]. Further, n o other conclusion would be consistent with the Directives , 
particularly article 3 of the Reorganisation Directive, which provides that the implementation of a 
reorganisation measure such as the August decision is a matter for the administrative or judicial 
authorities of the home state alone , and article 85 of the EBRRD, which provides that an appeal is not 
to entail any automatic suspension of the challenged decision  [34]. 
 
There is no basis for a reference to the CJEU, as the relevant propositions of EU law are beyond serious 
argument [35].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The adoption of closed material procedure requires specific statutory authority. The Justice and 
Security Act 2013 gave the High Court  a general  statutory power , in certain circumstances,  to receive 
“closed material ” which  is disclosed only to the court and  to a special advocate . As explained in the 
2011 Justice and Security Green Paper, the Act was a response to a growing nu mber of civil claims for 
damages against which the government was unable to defend at trial except through the unacceptably 
damaging disclosure of secret material. Those claims instead had to be settled [6-7]. 
 
The ordinary and natural meaning  of “proceedi ngs in a criminal cause or matter” include s proceedings 
by way of judicial review of a decision made in a criminal cause, and nothing in the context or purpose 
of the legislation suggests a different meaning.  In English criminal procedure many decisions  made in 
ongoing or prospective criminal proceedings are subject to judicial review in the High Court. Judicial 
review therefore cannot be regarded as an inherently civil proceeding. It is an integral part of the 
criminal justice system  [15-16]. Judicial inte rpretations of the phrase  “criminal cause or matter”  in the 
Judicature Acts primarily reflected the natural meaning of the words, rather than any  special feature of 
the Acts. A “cause ” is a proceeding, civil or criminal, actual or prospective, before a cou rt. A “matter” 
is something wide r, namely a particular legal subject -matter, although arising in a different proceeding. 
The appellants’  application is an attempt to require the DPP  to prosecute Sir Mark Allen. That is just 
as much a criminal matter as the  original decision not to  bring a prosecution . Parliament is unlikely to 
have intended to distinguish between different procedures having  the same criminal subject -matter  and 
being part  of the same criminal process ; but the draftsman could have done so  easily, for example by 
omitting the reference to a “matter” [17-20]. 
 
The Green Paper  indicates that the distinction between criminal and civil proceedings in section 6 
reflected  the greater degree of control exercisable by the government  in criminal cases , in which the 
prosecution can : (i) chose the material on which it r elies, (ii) seek to limit the disclosure of unused 
material on the grounds of public interest immunity; and (iii) withdraw the prosecution . That rationale 
does not require closed material pro cedure to be available in an ancillary judicial review of a decision 
made as an integral part of the criminal justice process, when it would not be available for an actual 
criminal trial [22-24]. 
 
Lord Mance agrees  that the appeal should be allowed, essent ially for the same reasons as Lord 
Sumption  [25-37].  
 
Lord Lloyd -Jones, with whom Lord Wilson agrees, would have dismissed the appea l. He concludes 
that the natural meaning and use of the word “cause” is appropriate to cover criminal proceedings 
which wil l result in a criminal  conviction or acquittal , and that  the word “matter” may extend beyond 
that to ancillary applications in such criminal proceedings  (such as disclosure applications and 
extradition proceedings) . They do not , however , naturally  include  this judicial review , which is a public 
law challenge extraneous to the criminal process. It is permissible to refer to the Green Paper in order 
to discern the purpose of the exclusion of “proceedings in a criminal cause or matter” from closed 
material pro cedure. The core concern behind the exclusion is to ensure that closed material procedure 
is unavailable where criminal guilt is being decided. These proceedings do not fall within the purpose 
of the exclusion [52-57].

The Supreme Court allows the appeal . Lord Kerr gives the judgment with which all the other Justices 
agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
When Parliament enacted the MSSCA, it consciously decided not to abolish same -sex civil 
partnerships or to extend them to different -sex couples, even though it was recognised at the time that 
this would bring about an inequality  of treatment between same -sex partners and those of different 
sexes, and that this inequality would be based on the sexual orientation of the two groups. It was 
decided that further investigations were required,  and the government concluded that it should  not The Supreme Court  of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 take a final decision on the future of civil partnerships until societal attitudes to them became clearer 
after same -sex marriages had taken root [7]. Government consultations since the introduction of the 
MSSCA have failed to produce a consensus as t o how , or if, the legal position relating to civil 
partnerships should change . The respondent  concluded that it was proportionate to obtain more data 
in order to decide whether there was a need to preserve civil partnerships  [9].  
 
The court rejects  the re spondent’s argument that European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) case law 
require s a wide margin of appreciation in relation to the timing of legislative change to recognise 
different forms of relationship , and that a significant measure of discretion shoul d be accorded to 
Parliament in its decision as to when the timing of legislative change in the field of civil partnerships 
should occ ur. Although a measure of latitude should be permitted to Parliament, t he concept of a 
“margin of appreciation” as applied by the ECtHR has no application in domestic law  – a national 
court must confront the interference with a n ECHR right and decide whether it is justified  [27-28]. In 
as much as there is a margin of discretion analogous to that applied by the ECtHR, in cases of unequal 
treatment on grounds of sexual orientation, the margin is narrow  [32]. It is reasonable  that the 
legislature  should be allowed time to reflect on what should be done when dealing with  an inequality 
that it has come to recognise due to evolving s ocietal attitude s. By contrast, to create a situation of 
inequality and then ask for time – in this case several years – to determine how that inequality is to be 
cured is  less obviously deserving of a margin of discretion. [36] 
 
There is a well establishe d four stage test to determine whether interference with a qualified ECHR 
right can be justified:  (a) is the legislative objective (legitimate aim) sufficiently important to justify 
limiting a fundamental right; (b) are the measures which have been designe d to meet it rationally 
connected to it; (c) are they no more than are necessary to accomplish it; and (d) do they strike a fair 
balance between the rights of the individual and the interests of the community ? [41]. 
 
To be legitimate, the aim must be intri nsically linked to the discriminatory treatment. In this case , it is 
not. Tolerance of discrimination while the respondent determines how best to remedy it cannot be 
characterised as a legitimate aim [42]. The government had to eliminate the inequality of treatment 
immediately  when the MSSCA came into force . This could have been done either by abolishing civil 
partnerships or by instantaneously extending them to different -sex couples. If the government had 
chosen one of these options, it might have been the oretically possible to then conduct research which 
could have influenced its longer term decision as to what to do with civil partnerships. Taking time to 
evaluate whether to abolish or extend could never , however,  amount to a legitimate aim for the 
contin uance of the discrimination  as it is not connected to the justification for discrimination  [50]. 
 
Even if the interference with the appellants’ rights in this case could be regarded as a legitimate aim, a 
fair balance between their rights and the interests  of the community has not been struck . The  interests 
of the community in denying civil partnerships to different -sex couples who do not wish to marry are 
unspecified, whereas the consequences of this denial for such couples may be far -reaching. A couple  
may, for example, suffer serious fiscal disadvantage if one of them dies before their relationship is 
formalised. There is no end point in sight for the present inequality of treatment  [52].  
 
The court has discretion as to whether to make a declaration of i ncompatibility and must decide 
whether it is appropriate to do so in a particular case. It should be noted that a  declaration of 
incompatibility does not oblige the government or Parliament to do anything , and in this case, the 
court should not feel retice nt about making such a declaration. The court therefore makes a 
declaration that sections 1 and 3 of the CPA, to the extent that they preclude a different -sex couple 
from entering into a civil partnership, are incompatible with article 14 taken in conjunct ion with article 
8 of the ECHR  [54-62].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Carnwath gives the judgment, with which 
Lord Mance, Lord Sumption, Lord Lloyd -Jones and Lord Briggs agree.   
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The statutory requirements f or registration for gross payment are highly prescriptive . They are 
contained in the Finance Act 2004 . They include a requirement that the applicant for registration 
complied , within the previous 12 months , with various tax obligations  subject to an except ion for non -
compliance with reasonable excuse. Section 66(1) of the Act provides that “the Board of Inland 
Revenue may at any time make a determination cancelling a person’s registration for gross payment” 
where certain conditions are satisfied. The word “ may” imports an element of discretion. The dispute 
is as to the scope  of that discretion  [5-8]. 
 
The company makes  two arguments. First, that the discretion under section 66 is unfettered in its 
terms, which do not exclude consideration of the consequences  of cancellation for the company . The 
company argues that, without any indication to the contrary, the impact on the company must be a 
relevant consideration  [16-17].  
 
Second, the company relies  on right to protection of property under Article 1 of the Fi rst Protocol to 
the European Convention on Human Rights (“A1/P1”) . It argues that cancellation clearly involves an 
interference with the possessions represented by (at least) the sub -contractor’s entitlement to the full 
contract price or the bundle of righ ts inherent in registration [18]. A1/P1 provides:  
 
“Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions No one 
shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions 
provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.  
 
The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a state to enforce 
such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general 
interes t or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.”  
 
HMRC generally adopt  the reasoning of the Court of Appeal  and do not accept that cancellation 
involves an interference with a possession for the purposes of A1 /P1. Alternatively, HM RC rely on  
the wide margin afforded to Member States under the Convention  in fiscal matters  [19-20]. 
 
The Supreme Court holds that the Court of Appeal was correct. Apart from the Convention, the 
company’s first argument, that the discretion under section 6 6 is unfettered, overlooks the basic 
principle that any statutory discretion must be exercised consistently with the objects and scope of the 
statutory scheme . The discretion does not extend to  consideration of  matters which relate neither to  
the requireme nts for registration for gross payment, nor to the objective of securing compliance with 
those requirements . The scheme is highly prescriptive , setting out narrowly -defined conditions for 
registration in the first place , including  a record of tax complianc e. The same conditions are brought  
into the cancellation procedure by section 66. The mere fact that the cancellation power is 
discretionary rather than  mandatory is unsurprising . Some element of flexibility allows for  cases where 
the failure is limited , temporary and poses no practical threat to the objectives of the CIS. It is wholly 
inconsistent with that tightly drawn scheme for there to be implied a general dispensing power  [21-22]. 
 
Turning to A1/P1 , there is force in  the argument of HMRC that, even i f the rights conferred by 
registration  amount to “possessions”, they cannot extend beyond the limits set by the legislation by 
which they are created. However, it is unnecessary  to decide the appeal on that basis , since the Court 
of Appeal correctly held  that any interference  with A1/P1 rights  was proportionate. Once it is 
accepted that the statute does not in itself require the consideration of the impact on the individual 
taxpayer , there is nothing in A1 /P1 which would justify the court in reading in such  a requirement  
[23].

The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The UT correctly concluded that PBL was the “vendor” under s71A(2) and therefore that MAR’s purchase 
of the barracks fr om PBL was exempt from SDLT [23]. Various reasons support this finding . For instance, 
there is nothing within s71A which suggests that the exemption in s71A(2) will not apply when the sale by 
the customer to the financial institution is a sub -sale which takes place contemporaneously and in connection 
with the customer’s purchase of the major interes t in land [24-28]. The disregard in the tailpiece of s45(3) 
has no bearing on the operation of s71A(2) [30]. 
 
In this case, but for s75A (a general and broadly drafted anti -avoidance provision [44-45]), the combination 
of the sub -sale relief under s45(2) and s45(3) and the exemption under s71A(2) relieved the sale by the MoD 
to PBL and exempted the sale by PBL to MAR from a charge to SDLT [34-35]. It is unsurprising that s75A 
was only introduced over one year  after the combination of s45 and s71A could ope rate in this way . S75A 
was enacted by Parliament to close such lacunas  [31-33]. In this case, t he party referr ed to as “V” in s75A is 
the MoD [46]. Looking at s75 as a whole, and taking a purposive approach to interpretation, “P” as referred 
to in s75A is PBL.  PBL did not obtain a chargeable interest on 31 January 2008 because the contract between 
it and the MoD fell to be disregarded under s45(3) . PBL acquired its chargeable interest, a leasehold interest , 
following the sub -sale to MAR and the lease back t o PBL. These transactions were transactions “involved in 
connection with” the disposal by MoD of its chargeable interest  (s75A(1)(b))  [46-49].  
 
S75A(1)(c) requires that the sum of the amounts of SDLT payable in respect of the scheme transactions  
(which in this case is £nil)  is less than the amount that would be payable on a notional land transaction 
effecting the acquisition of V’s chargeable interest by P on its disposal by V. In this case, t he relevant notional 
land transaction involves PBL acq uiring MoD’s interest in the barracks [56]. S75A(5) provides that the 
chargeable consideration on the notional transaction is the largest amount (or aggregate amount) given by 
any one person for the scheme transactions. HMRC correctly asserted that the re levant sum is £1.25bn ( the 
purchase price which MAR contracte d to pay to PBL) . SDLT due t hereon is £50m (although this  is subject 
to PBL’s right to make a claim under s80 of FA 2003 ) [57-64]. 
 
S75B does not assist PBL.  This section operates by excluding “in cidental” transactions from the calculation 
of the chargeable consideration on the notional transaction for the purposes of s75A(5). However, s 75B(2) 
and s75B(6) support the conclusion that both the sub -sale to MAR and the grant by MAR of the lease to 
PBL are included in the transactions which transfer the chargeable interest from V to P  for the purposes of 
s75A(5) [68-72]. Therefore, the £1.25 billion consideration which MAR contracted to pay to PBL is the 
relevant consideration under s75A(5)(a )[73]. 
 
PBL also argued that s75A(5) and s75B read together indirectly discriminates against those of Islamic faith 
(who may be expected to adopt Shari’a financing techniques ) contrary to the European Convention on 
Human Rights [66; 74]. This matter can be determined on the simple bases (a) that any discriminatory effect 
is objectively justified and (b) that, in any event, PBL is not a victim [75-80]. Various procedural challenges 
by PBL are also rejected  [81-86]. Finally, a different approach suggested in Emmet and Fa rrand on Title whereby 
the transfer of the Chelsea barracks to MAR in the Ijara transaction should be viewed in English law as a 
mortgage  such that MAR should have been registere d as the proprietor of a charge (which is exempt from 
SDLT)  would be contrary to the legislative scheme in FA 2003 [87-91]. 
 
In Lord Briggs’ view , the transfer from PBL to MAR was not exempt under s71A(2) because PBL was not 
the “vendor” under the relevant land transaction within the combined meaning of sections 45(5A)(b) and  
71A(2). The vendor was the MoD [101] . Lord Briggs considers that this analysis achieves rather than wholly 
frustrates the underlying purpose of the relevant provisions, namely to charge land transactions involving 
sub-sales or Islamic finance to a single charge to SDLT, rather than there being no charge at all.  T he contrary 
result cannot be what Parliament intended  [109], at a time when there was no recourse to s 75A [129] . In 
response, Lord Hodge notes that Lord Briggs’ approach results i n different inter pretations of “vendor” under 
s71A(2) and s73(2). He finds  HMRC’s explanation of a patchwork of provisions and a lacuna (remedied by 
s75A) more persuasive [36-38].

The Supreme Court  unanimously  dismisses the appeal . Lord Wilson gives the judgment with which Lady 
Hale, Lord Hughes, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd -Jones agree. The tribunal was entitled to conclude that 
Mr Smith qualified as a ‘worker ’ under s.230(3)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (and by analogy 
the rel evant provisions of the Working Time Regulations 1998 and the Equality Act 2010), and his 
substantive claims can proceed to be heard.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Conceptually, it is both legitimate and convenient to treat the three positive findings  of the  tribunal as 
having been founded upon a conclusion that Mr Smith was a ‘worker’ within the meaning of s.230(3)(b) 
of the Employment Rights Act 1996  (otherwise known as a ‘limb (b) worker’)  [15]. This was because 
regulation 2(1) of the Working Time Regulati ons defines ‘worker’ in identical terms  to s.230(3)(b) , and 
case law has suggested  that the meaning of ‘employment’ in s.83(2) of the Equality Act is also essentially 
the same  [12-15].  
 
The Supreme Court of t he United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Proceeding on that basis, if Mr Smith was to qualify as a ‘limb (b)’ worker under s.230(3)(b) then it was 
necessary for him to have undertaken to personally perform his work or services for Pimlico  Plumbers , 
and that the company be neither his client nor h is customer.  
 
When considering whether Mr Smith had undertaken  to provide  a personal service, it was relevant that  
when working for Pimlico Mr Smith had a limited facility (not found in his written contracts) to appoint 
another Pimlico operative to do a j ob he had previously quoted for but no longer wished to undertake  
[24-5]. However, it is helpful to assess the significance of this ‘right to substitute’ by considering whether 
the dominant feature of the contract remained personal performance on his part. In this case the terms 
of the contract  (which referred  to ‘your skills’ etc. ) are clearly directed to performance by Mr Smith 
personally , and any right to substitute was signif icantly limited by the fact that the substitute had to come 
from the ranks of those bound to Pimlico in similar terms.  Consequently, the tribunal was entitled to 
hold that the dominant feature of Mr Smith’s contract with the company was an obligation of pe rsonal 
performance  [32-34].  
 
On the issue of whether Pimlico Plumbers was a client or customer of Mr Smith , the tribunal had 
legitimately found that there was an umbrella contract between the  parties , i.e. one which cast obligations 
on Mr Smith even when he was between assignments for Pimlico . It was therefore not necessary to 
consider what impact a finding that there was no umbrella contract  (and therefore that the contractual 
obligations subsisted only during the actual assignments ) would have had on the  ‘limb (b)’ analysis  [37, 
41]. Instead, one had to look at the wording of the written contractual documents  to determine whether 
Pimlico was a client or customer of Mr Smith. On the one hand, Mr Smith was free to reject a particular 
offer of work , and was free to accept outside work if no work was offered by any of Pimlico’s clients. 
He also bore some of the financial risk of the work, and the manner in which he undertook it was not 
supervised by Pimlico. However, there were also features of the contract wh ich strongly militated against 
recognition of Pimlico as a client or customer of Mr Smith . These  includ ed Pimlico’s tight control over 
Mr Smith’s attire and the administrative aspects of any job , the severe terms as to when and how much 
it was obliged to p ay him, and the suite of covenants restricting his working activities following 
termination  [47-48]. Accordingly, the tribunal was entitled to conclude that Pimlico cannot be regarded 
as a client or customer of Mr Smith [ 49].

The Supreme Court  unanimously allows the appeal , so far as concerns the cost of complying with the 
injunction. The respondents will be ordered to indemnify the ISPs for the disputed  implementation  
costs, but the judge was entitled to order the ISPs to pay the litigation costs. Lord Sumption gives the 
judgment , with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The English courts have long had jurisdiction in certain circumstances to order innocent parties to 
assist those whose rights have been invaded by a wrongdoer . That includes the jurisdiction exercised in 
Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Coms [1974] AC 133 which is commonly  exercised for the 
purpose of assisting  claimant s to bring or maintain proceedings against  wrongdoers , generally  by 
ordering innocent intermediaries  to provide  information.  The ordinary rule  is that the intermediary is 
entitled to the costs of compliance  with a Norwich Pharmacal order . Orders for the disclosure of 
information are  only one category of order which  can be made  against a third party to prevent the use 
of his facilities for wrong doing  [8-12].  
 
National laws concerning intellectual  property righ ts are partially harmonised by a series of EU 
Directives, of which three are relevant: the E -Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, the Information 
Security Directive 2001/29/EC and the Enforcement Directive 2004/48/EC . The E -Commerce 
Directive  requires Member Sta tes to introduce  limitations of liability (“safe harbours”) in respect of  
certain activities  undertaken by “information society services” , which  include ISPs  [16-17]. None of 
the Directives deals expressly with the costs of enforcing a judicial remedy, as between the rights -
holder and an information society  service [28].  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 In the Court of Appeal , Kitchen LJ  viewed the  recitals to the E -Commerce Directive  as implicitly 
support ing an order for the intermediary to bear the  implementation costs . He suggested  that, under 
the Directives , liability for the  costs of compliance was the quid pro quo of the immunities and the 
absence of any general obligation owed by  ISPs to monitor information which they transmit or store . 
Kitchen LJ found support for his analysis  in the reason s of the Court of Justice of the EU (“CJEU”)  in 
L’Oréal SA v eBay International AG  (Case C -324/09) [2012] Bus LR 1369 and UPC Telekabel Wien GmbH 
v Constantin Film Verl eigh GmbH (Case C -314/12) [2014] Bus LR 541  [28-29].  
 
The Supreme Court disag rees. First, the recitals refer the terms of an injunction against an intermediary 
to national law, without any further guidance  [30(1) ]. Second, the quid pro quo argument assumes what 
it seeks to prove: the Directives do not deal at all with the costs of complying with an injunction 
against an intermediary,  so there is nothing from which such an inference could be drawn  [30(2)]. 
Third, the rationale of the immunities , as explained in the recitals , is that disparities between national 
laws on liability can distort the functioning of the single market, and that the intermediaries have little 
or no control over content. It has nothing to do with the incidence of compliance costs when an 
injunction is granted  [30(3)]. Fourth, the CJEU authorities say nothing about the incidence of 
compliance costs but only that , so far as they are to be borne by the intermediary , they must not be 
excessive  [30(4), (5)]. 
 
The incidence of compliance costs is a matter for English  law, within the broad limits set by the EU 
principles  of effectiveness and equivalence, and the requirement that any remedy should be fair 
proportionate and not unnecessarily costly . In English law , the incidence of costs generally depends on 
the legal di stribution of risk as found by the court.  An innocent intermediary is  ordinarily  entitled to be 
indemnified by the rights -holder against the costs of complying with a website -blocking order . That is 
no different in principle from the established position in domestic law in the case of other orders  
granted to require an innocent party to assist the claimant against a wrongdoer.  An ISP serving as a 
mere conduit would not incur liability for trade mark infringement under English law even in the 
absence of the safe harbour provisions. There is no legal basis for requiring a party to shoulder the 
burden of remedying an injustice  if he has no legal responsibility and is acting under the compulsion of 
an order of the court  [31-33].  
 
It has sometimes been suggested that because ISPs benefit financial ly from the volume and appeal of 
the content available on the internet, including con tent which infringes intellectual property rights, it is 
fair to make them contribute to the cost of enforcement. That assumes a degree of responsibility on 
the part of the intermediary which does not correspond to any legal standard . The law is not genera lly 
concerned with moral or commercial responsibilities except as an arguable basis for legal ones .  Even if 
a moral or commercial responsibility were relevant, it would be hard to discern one in a case like this. 
Website -blocking injunctions are sought by  rights -holders in their own commercial interest. There is 
no reason why the rights -holder should be entitled to look for a contribution to the cost of defending  
his rights from  anyone other than the infringers  [34-35]. 
 
It follows that in principle the ri ghts-holders should indemnify the ISPs for the compliance costs , 
subject to the limits on relief set by  EU law. There is no reason to believe that such an indemnity, 
which must be limited to reasonable costs, would exceed those limits.  The costs  are not  excessive, 
disproportionate or such as to impair the  respondents’ ability to  enforce  their rights . Critically, the  
intermediary in this case is legally innocent. Different considerations may apply to those  engaging in 
caching or hosting , which  involve greate r participation in the infringement  and which are more likely 
to infringe national intellectual property laws if “safe harbour ” immunity is unavailable  [36-37]. 
 
As to the costs of the litigation, the judge  awarded the m against the  ISPs because , unusually , they had 
made the litigation a test case  and had strenuously resisted the application. He was plainly entitled to 
do so  [38].

A majority of the court  dismisses the appeal. A majority  (Lord Mance, Lord Reed, Lady Black and 
Lord Lloyd -Jones) concludes that NIHRC does not ha ve standing to bring these proceedings. As such , 
the court does not have jurisdiction to make a declaration of incompatibility in this case. A minority of 
the court (Lady Hale, Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson) consider s that NIHRC does have standing to bring 
these proceedings.  
 
A majority of the court (Lady Hale, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson) does however consider 
that the current law in Northern Ireland is disproportionate and i ncompatible with Art 8 ECHR 
insofar as that law prohibits abortion in cases  of (a) fatal foetal abnormality , (b) pregnancy as a result 
of rape and (c) pregnancy as a result of incest. Lady Black joins that majority  on (a) but not on (b) or 
(c). A minority of the court (Lord Reed, Lady Black on (b) and (c) and Lord Lloyd -Jones) co nsider s 
that it is not possible to conclude in the abstract, in proceedings of the present nature (as distinct from 
individual applications) , that the current law is disproportionate or incompatible with Art 8. A majority 
of the court (Lord Mance, Lord Ree d, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd -Jones) concludes  that the current 
law, in the abstract, is not incompatible with Art 3 ECHR. A minority of the court (Lord Kerr and 
Lord Wilson) disagrees and considers  that it is. Lady Hale expresses sympathy with the view exp ressed 
by Lord Kerr but does not consider it necessary to decide on incompatibility in relation to Art 3 in 
light of her decision  on Art 8.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Standing  
 
Lord Mance (with whom  Lord Reed, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd -Jones agree ) consi ders that  NIHRC 
does not have standing to bring these proceeding s. They were not instituted by identifying any 
unlawful a ct or any potential victim of it  [73].   
 
NIHRC relies on s. 69(5)(b) of the NIA 1998 for its power to institute  these proceedings. Thes e 
proceedings constitute ‘human rights proceedings’ under s.71(2C)( a)(ii) and are therefore subject to the 
restrictions in s.71(2B)  [54]. Under s.71(2B)  and (2C) , where NIHRC is inst ituting human rights 
proceedings, it need not be  a victim , but there must be an actual or potential victim of an unlawful act 
to which the proceedings relate [54 and 56].  
 
S.71(2C)(b) states that an expression used in s.71(2B) has the same meaning as the same expression 
used in s.7 HRA 1998. S.7 HRA 1998 refers to s.6(1) for th e concept of ‘unlawful act’. It does not 
apply to an authority’s act which was (a) compelled by a provision of primary legislation or was (b) to 
give effect to or enforce one or more provisions of or made under primary legislation which cannot be 
read or g iven effect in a way which is compatible with ECHR rights. Further, under s.6(6) HRA 1998, 
an act does not include a failure to introduce or lay before Parliament a proposal for legislation or 
make any primary legislation [57]. It follows that NIHRC’s powe rs under ss.69 and 71 NIA 1998 do 
not include either instituting or intervening in proceedings where the only complaint is that primary 
legislation , such as the 1861 Act,  is incompatible with the ECHR  because such proceedings would not 
involve any ‘unlawfu l act’ within the meaning of ss.6 and 7 HRA 1998 and consequently s.71 NIA 
1998  [58]. It is no surprise that Parliament did not provide for NIHRC to have capacity to pursue 
what would amount to unconstrained actio popularis regarding the interpretation or compatibility of 
primary legislation with Convention rights [61].  
 
The 1945 Act , as an act of a devolved legislature , is not primary legislation. It might have been open to 
NIHRC to claim that the failure of the Northern Ireland Assembly to repeal or amen d s.25 constituted 
an ‘unlawful act’ within the meaning of ss.6 and 7 HRA 1998. However, NIHRC, pursuant to s.71(2B), 
would still have to demonstrate that there is or would be one or more victims of the unlawful act. That 
restriction is not satisfied by a general assertion that the failure to abrogate or amend s.25 is likely to 
give rise to victims. There must be a specific and identifiable victim who is or would be the victim of The S upreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 an unlawful a ct [72]. Even if NIHRC could establish standing regarding the 194 5 Act  it would have 
little practical effect given the ongoing effect of the 1861 Act [72].  
 
A minority of the court (Lady Hale, Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson) concludes that NIHRC does have 
standing to bring these proceedings. Lady Hale and Lord Kerr (with wh om Lord Wilson agrees) hold 
that there are two separate  species of challenge under the HRA 1998. One is for victims to bring 
proceedings in respect of an unlawful act of a public authority, or to rely on such an unlawful act in 
other proceedings, pursuant to s.7(1). The other is to challenge the compatibility of legislation under 
ss. 3 and 4 irrespective of whether there has been any unlawful act by a public authority . NIHRC has 
standing to bring such proceedings by virtue of s.69(5)(b)  [17 and 183 -184].  
 
In Lady Hale’s view s. 71(2B) and (2C) deal only with proceedings brought by NIHRC or interventions 
by NIHRC in proceedings brought by others in respect of claims that a public authority has acted or 
proposes to act unlawfully. But it does not apply to or limit the general power of the NIHRC to 
challenge the compatibility of legislation under ss. 3 and 4 of HRA 1998. The ‘unlawful act’ means ‘the 
unlawful act alleged in the proceedings’ so does not apply where no such unlawful act is alleged  [18].  
 
In Lord  Kerr’s view  the only restriction on NIHRC’s power to bring proceedings under s.69(5)(b)  
NIA 1998  is that the proceedings must involve law or practice relating to human rights  [184] . Under 
s.71(2B)(c) the NIHRC may act only if ‘there is or would be one or more victims of the unlawful act ’. 
‘Would be victims ’ indicates an intention that NIHRC should be able to act pre-emptively [195] . The 
majority decision departs in his view from well -established authority that an interpretation of a statute 
which gives eff ect to the ascertainable will of Parliament should be preferred to a literal construction 
which will frustrate the legislation’s true purpose [202-213]. S.71(2B)(c) can reasonably be interpreted 
to mean that NIHRC may act where it is clear that there have been and will be victims of the 
implementation of the provisions of the 1861 and 1945 Acts , which is satisfied  in this case [195 and 
208]. If NIHRC is unable to bring proceedings to protect the rights of wom en in the three situations 
in this case , they will be deprived of a n effective remedy under  Art 13 ECHR [199] .  
 
Article 8   
 
The court’s decision on standing means that there is no possibility of making a declaration of 
incompatibility  under s.4 HRA 1998 . However,  a majority  of the court  (Lady Hale, Lor d Mance, Lord 
Kerr and Lord Wilson) consider s that the current law in Northern Ireland on abortion is 
disproportionate  and incompatible with Art 8 insofar as it prohibits abortion in cases of (a) fatal (as 
distinct from serious) foetal abnormality (b) preg nancy as a result of rape and (c) pregnancy as a result 
of incest. If an individual victim did return to court  in relation to the present law, a formal declaration 
of incompatibility would in all likelihood be made. Lady Hale agrees with the reasons provid ed by 
Lord Mance and Lord Kerr and writes separately only on a few points. Lady Black joins th e majority in 
relation to (a) but not in relation to (b) and (c) .   
 
The majority on this issue starts from the position that the current law is an interference w ith the right 
of pregnant women and girls to respect for their private lives , guaranteed by Art 8(1). The question is 
whether the Northern Ireland abortion law is justified under Art 8(2) [9, 104 , 263 and 265 ]. The 
majority concludes that it is not.  
 
Lord Mance and Lord Kerr (with whom Lord Wilson agrees) hold that the general clarity of the 
existing law on abortion was not the focus of the present appeal . Lord Mance holds that it is clear that 
all the categories in issue are prohibited under the 1861 and 1 945 Acts [81, 105 and 269] . Lady Hale 
considers that it is no more uncertain than other areas of law which rely upon the application of 
particular concepts to particular facts [20]. 
 
All of the majority accept that the current law pursues a legitimate aim:  the moral interest in protecting 
the life, health and welfare of the unborn  child [21, 105 and 278]. Lady Hale highlights that the 
community also has an interest in protecting the life, health and welfare of the pregnant woman [21]. 
It is accepted that th e unborn are not right holders under Art 2  ECH R and do not have a right to life The S upreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 in domestic law or in  Northern Ireland [21, 24, 94 and 305-306]. The law as it currently stands already 
permits abortion  to protect not only the life of the pregnant woman but also her mental health from 
serious long -term injury [24 and 106-108].  
 
The majority  refer to the opinion polls produced by NIHRC demonstrating strong public support for 
changes in the law [24, 110 and 322 ]. Lord Mance accepts that views elicited by opini on polls cannot 
prevail over the decision to date by the Northern Ireland Assembly which is to maintain the existing 
policy and law [111] . However, Lady Hale and Lord Kerr (with whom Lord Wilson agrees) state that 
this evidence cannot be lightly dismissed when the argument is that profound moral views of the 
public are sufficient to outweigh the grave interference on the rights of pregnant women and a change 
in the law [24 and 325] . All of the majority however agree that the Working Group established by the  
Northern Irish Assembly demonstrates that the Assembly is not necessarily opposed to amending the 
law in the future but that any such solution has been precluded by the cessation of the Assembly’s 
activities since January 2017 [112 and 228 -229].  
 
The maj ority holds that the banning of abortion in all the categories at issue is rationally connected to 
the legitimate aim [113 and 279] . The  real issue on this appeal is whether the interference with 
women’s Art 8 rights is necessary in a democratic society in  that it strikes a  fair balance  between the 
rights of the pregnant woman and the interests of the foetus  by maintaining the 1861 and 1925 Acts 
[21, 117 and 287] . 
 
The majority all refer  to the  institutional  role of the UKSC in relation to the legislature . A distinction is 
drawn between the margin of appreciation applied by Strasbourg and considerations of institutional 
competence required in a domestic context [37-28, 115 and 289 -295]. Lady Hale remarks that this is 
not a matter on which the domestic legisl ature enjoys a unique competence. Lady Hale, Lord Mance 
and Lord Kerr all highlight that Parliament,  through s.4 HRA 1998 , has expressly given the high courts 
power to rule on compatibility of legislation with the ECHR  [39 and 292] .  
 
The majority on this issue also distinguish es the present case from  R (Nicklinson)  [2014] UKSC 38  in 
reaching a decision that it is institutionally appropriate for the Supreme Court to consider the 
compatibility of the existing law on abortion with the Convention rights.  The Northern Irish 
Assembly is not about to actively consider the issue of abortion – there is  no assurance as to when it 
will resume its activity  [40, 117 and 299 ]. There  is no question of a balance being struck between the 
interests of two different living p ersons as in Nicklinson . The unborn foetus is not in law a person , 
although its potential must be respected  [119] . Nicklinson  was also decided against a background where 
the attitude maintained by the UK Parliament reflected a similar attitude across almos t the whole of 
Europe. N orthern Ireland , in contrast, is almost alone in the strictness of its current law . The close ties 
between the different parts and peoples of the UK make it appropriate to examine the justification for 
differences in this area with care [120] . Lord Kerr also distinguishes the present case from Nicklinson  
on the basis that the present in compatibility is not difficult to identify or cure. A simple amendment to 
the 1861 and 1945 Acts permitting termination of pregnancy in the three situ ations would achieve that 
aim [298] .  
 
Fatal f oetal abnormality : the majority and Lady Black conclude  that there  is no community interest in 
obliging the woman to carry a pregnancy to term where the foetus suffers from a fatal abnormality  [28, 
133, 326, 36 8 and 371] . Lord Mance remarks that the present law treats the pregnant woman as a 
vehicle and fails to attach any weight to her personal autonomy [125] . The present law also fails to 
achieve its objective in the case of those who may choose to travel for an abortion, merely imposing 
on them harrowing stress and inconvenience as well as expense, while it imposes severe and 
sometimes life -time suffering on the most vulnerable who,  because of lack of information, or support 
are forced to carry their pregnancy  to term [27, 28  and 126].  
 
Serious foetal abnormality : By contrast , it is not possible to impugn as disproportionate and incompatible 
with Art 8 legislation that prohibits abortion of a foetus diagnosed as likely to be seriously disabled. A 
disabled chil d should be treated as having equal  worth in human terms as a non -disabled child [31, 133 
and 331 ].  The S upreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
Rape: the majority consider s that the current law is disproportionate in cases of rape and that the rights 
of the pregnant woman should prevail over the c ommunity interest in the continuance of the 
pregnancy [27, 127 and 326] . Lord Mance mentions that NIHRC made it clear that its submissions on 
rape included offences against children  under the age of 13  who could not give consent in law  but that 
it had not focused on sexual offences (not described as rape) committed against girls aged 13 or more 
but under the age of 16  [44]. Lady Hale , however,  considers that for the purposes of this case, it is 
unnecessary to distinguish between offence s where the child is under 13 and offences where the child 
is under 16 where no offence is committed if the perpetrator reasonably believed she was over 16 . It is 
presumed under the law of Northern Ireland that children under 16 are incapable of giving consent  to 
sexual touchi ng, including penetration of the vagina by a penis , irrespective of the per petrator’s belief  
and there is no reason to exclude such pregnancies from this case  [25]. Lord Mance considers that 
causing a woman to become pregnant and bear a child against her w ill is an invasion of the 
fundamental right to bodily integrity. Neither Lord Mance nor Lady Hale consider the  possibility of 
travel for an abortion as a justification for the law  but rather a factor demonstrating its 
disproportionality  [27 and 127].  
 
Incest: A blanket prohibition of abortion in cases of incest is not proportionate  [27, 132 and 326] . Lord 
Mance (with whom Lady Hale agrees ) points to the fact that t he most typical cases of incest involve 
abusive  relationships with young or younger female re latives.  The agony of having to carry a child to 
birth and have a potential responsibility and lifelong relationship with the child thereafter against the 
mother’s will cannot be justified [27 and 132] .  
 
Lord Reed (with whom Lord Lloyd -Jones and Lady Blac k (on pregnancy resulting from rape and 
incest)  agree ) would not make a declaration of incompatibility under Art 8. They are not convinced 
that the three situations are , as abstract categor ies, materially different from those explored in  the case 
of A, B a nd C v Ireland (2011) 53 EHRR 13 . Women are free to travel to obtain abortions on the NHS 
in England and Scotland . They should be provided with advice about termination , by medical 
professionals in Northern Ireland, and should receive whatever care they ma y require there after the 
termination has been carried out [357 and 369] . The court has been provided with information about 
individual cases which , if established in individual applications , would almost certainly demonstrate 
violations of Art 8, due prin cipally  to shortcomings in the provision of medical advice and support . 
However, this does not warrant a bald declaration that the legislation as such is inherently 
incompatible with Art 8 [359] . The difficult y with the form of the present appeal is that i t does not 
enable  the court to examine the facts of individual cases [361 and 369] . Defining categories of 
pregnancy in which abortions should be permitted involves h ighly sensitive and contentious questions 
of moral judgment  [362] . They are pre -eminently matters to be settled by democratically elected and 
accountable institutions [362 and 369] . That democratic consideration has not been completed in 
Northern Ireland as a result in the breakdown of devolved government in January 2017. However,  
there is ever y reason to fear that violations of the ECHR will occur if the arrangements in place in 
Northern Ireland remain as they are [363 and 370] .  
 
Article 3  
 
A majority of the court (Lord Mance, Lord Reed, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd -Jones) would not have 
made a d eclaration that the law of Northern Ireland is incompatible with Art 3 ECHR  [34 and 100] .  
 
Art 3 is an absolute right. T he treatment complained of has to reach a ‘minimum level of severity’ in 
order to contravene it [95]. The majority all agree that there  will be some women in the three 
situations in this case, whose suffering on being denied an abortion in Northern Ireland will reach the 
threshold of severity required to label the treatment ‘inhuman or degrading’. But  Lord Mance notes 
that it cannot be sa id that legally significant number of wom en denied an abortion in such 
circumstances will suffer so severely that her Art 3 rights have been violated  [82]. Whether there has 
been any violation also  depend s on the facts of the individual case [34, 95, 103, 354 and 367] . Lord 
Mance (with whom Lord Reed, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd -Jones agree) considers that the cases relied 
on by NIHRC to demonstrate breach of Art 3: RR v Poland  (2011) 53 EHRR 31, P & S v Poland  [2012] The S upreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 129 BMLR 120 and Tysiac v Poland  (2007) 4 5 EHRR 412 were decided on an assessment of the actual 
circumstances of the conduct relied on. They were not decided on the basis of a  risk that the State 
might commit a  breach of Art 3 [100, 353 and 367]. Lord Mance  (with whom Lord Reed,  Lord  Lloyd -
Jones and Lady Black agree ) notes that women are able to travel elsewhere to obtain an abortion. 
Although t his can be a distressing and expensive experience , it does not generally or necessarily give 
rise to distress of such severity so as to infringe Art 3: see A, B and C  [100, 353 and 367] .  
 
A minority (Lord Kerr with whom Lord Wilson agrees ) would have made a declaration that the law of 
Northern Ireland is incompatible with Art 3 ECHR  insofar as it prohibits abortion in the three 
categories of case presented  [262] . Even though some mothers may not, there is a risk that some 
mothers who are denied an abortion in cases (a), (b) and (c) above will suffer profound psychological 
trauma which is sufficient to give rise to a violation of Art 3 [235] . The state owes i ndividuals an 
obligation to protect them from the risk of a breach of Art 3 as well as a positive duty to provide 
appropriate healthcare treatment where the denial of that treatment would expose victims to ill -
treatment contrary to Art 3 [235] . The risk of  women and girls being subject to ill -treatment contrary 
to Art 3 is sufficient to trigger the state’s positive obligations.  Travelling to England or Scotland to 
obtain an abortion does not avoid this. The fact of being required to do so is in itself suffi cient to 
expose women and girls to the risk of inhuman and degrading treatment [238] .  
 
Lady Hale expresses sympathy with the view expressed by Lord Kerr (with whom Lord Wilson agrees) 
but does not consider it necessary to decide on incompatibility in rela tion to Art 3 in light of her 
decision  on Art 8 [34].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
‘Acting Maliciously’  
The attempted smugglers were not ‘acting maliciously’ within Clause 1.5 [30]. An element of spite, ill -
will or the like is required , although this is not limited to conduc t directed towards the insured interest . 
An act directed with the relevant mental element towards causing the loss of or damage or injury to 
other property or towards a person could lead to consequential loss of or damage to an insured interest 
within Clau se 1.5 [28]. The attempted smuggling can not here be regarded as aimed at the detention of 
or any loss or damage to the Vessel or any property or person  [29].  
 
Clause 1.5 must be read in its immediate context and in the light of the recent marine insurance  
authorities which would have been in the minds of the drafters of the Institute Clauses [28]. With  
regard  to context, what the drafters appear to have had in mind are persons whose actions  are aimed at 
causing loss  of or damage to the vessel or other prop erty or persons as a by -product of which the 
vessel is lost or damaged. Detection of the smuggled drugs and any consequent loss or damage to the 
Vessel were the exact opposite of the unknown smugglers’ aim [14]. 
 
The Institute Clauses  were issued on 1 Octo ber 1983 [15]. They were drafted to bring fresh order and 
clarity to many of the concepts used in the market. Prior authority on the concept of persons acting 
maliciously is therefore relevant [16]. The Mandarin Star  [1968] 2 Lloyd’s Law Rep 47 and The Sal em 
[1982] 1 QB 946  establish that for a person to be acting maliciously an element of spite or ill will 
towards someone is required . The  (earlier ) Institute Clauses  were held to be obviously intended to deal 
with damage effected in the course of some civil  disturbance  [17]. Whether the malice had to be 
directed to the cargo owner as opposed to the goods themselves was left unclear [17 and 20]. 
Authorities dealing with malice in a tortious context and Victoria n criminal law statutes from  1861 do 
not provide helpful guidance to the meaning of ‘any person acting maliciously’ in Clause 1.5  [25-28]. 
 
The Operation of Clause 4.1.5  
Even if the attempted smugglers had been ‘acting maliciously’ within Clause 1.5, the Appellant’s c laim 
was still excluded under Clause 4.1.5 as arising, at least concurrently, from detainment by reason of 
infringement of customs regulations [55]. First, Clause  4.1.5 is applicable to circumstances falling 
within Clause 1.5 . It would be surprising if an insured could improve its position by  invoking one 
particular sub -clause of Clause 1, such as Clause 1.5 , as opposed to Clauses 1.2 or 1.6. Further, the 
owners are relying on Clause 3 to establish constructive total loss which is exactly the subject -matter of 
Clause 4.1.5 [32]. Second,  neithe r as a matter of causation nor as a matter of construction, is it possible 
to treat Clause 4.1.5 as inapplicable by drawing some distinction between the malicious act and the 
infringement of customs regulations  as the proximate, real or effective cause of the loss [39]. The two 
are here effectively the same.  Even if some meaningful distinction could be drawn  between them, it 
does not follow that th ere is a binary choice between two competing proximate, real or effect ive causes 
of the insured loss.  
 
What is required is a construction of the particular wording, giving effect at each stage to the natural 
meaning of the words in their context [40]. The general aim in insurance law is to identify a single real, 
effective or proximate cause of any loss, but in some cases there may be two concurrent causes of loss, 
particularly where an exception takes certain perils out of the prima facie cover [43]. Where an insured 
loss arises from the combination of two causes, one insured, the other excluded, the exclusion 
prevents recovery [49]. Here two potential causes can be identified viz the malicious act and the 
subsequent seizure and detainment. It was the combination of the two that was fatal. As the  seizure 
and detainment arose  from the excluded peril of infringement o f customs regulations, the Appellant’s  
claim fails [49].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Carnwath gives the lead judgment, with 
which the other Justices agree. Lord Sumption and Lord Briggs gi ve concurring judgments.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Domestic  administrative  law does not recognise a distinct principle of equal treatment. Consistency is a 
generally desirable objective, but not an absolute rule [24]. In this case the OFT was applying a single The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament S quare London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 set of legal and policy criteria to a limited group of parties within a single area of business activity , and  
its commitment to equal treatment ha d been expressed in terms to those parties. To that extent, they 
had a legitimate expectation of equal  treatment ; but that tells one nothing about the legal consequences 
of such an expectation  [29-30]. 
 
Although procedural unfairness or impropriety is a well -established ground  of judicial review, 
substantive unfairness as such is not. References to  “conspi cuous unfairness” or “abuse of power”  in 
the case law  add nothing to the ordinary principles of judicial review by which this case must be judged 
[31-42]. 
 
Even accepting that there was a breach of a legitimate expectation in the failure to replicate the 
assurances given to TMR in 2008, that would not in itself provide a basis for financial remedy in 
relation to the events of 2012, nor the reversal of financial penalties which had by then been lawfully 
imposed on, and accepted by, the respondents . It makes no difference to the result whether one 
applies a test of “objective justification” or one of “rationality” [43].  
 
All those who entered ER As knew  of the possibility that other parties would appeal succe ssfully . That 
was a risk the respondents took knowin gly. TMR did not. TMR  sought and obtained an assurance on 
which it claimed to have relied. In 2012  the OFT could reasonably take the view that, if the assurance 
were not honoured, TMR would have had a strong case for permission to appeal to the CAT out of 
time, whereas the respondents did not. If objective justification were needed for OFT taking a 
different approach to TMR, that was sufficient . [44-45]. 
 
Lord Sumption adds that the assurance given to TMR was a mistake  because it was inconsistent with 
the O FT’s policy of non -discrimination , the terms of the ERA under discussion , and the purpose of 
the Early Resolution  proce dure [51-52]. That, however, cannot affect  the position of the respondents, 
each of whom had entered into a distinct ERA which was intend ed finally to resolve the issues which 
were the subject of the CAT appeals, subject only to the ir right to either (i) terminate the ERA before 
the final OFT  decision or (ii) appeal to the CAT after that decision. They invoked neither option, thus 
accepting  the risk that they would not benefit from an y other party’s  successful appeal  but ensuring 
that they would retain the benefit of the discounted sanction if the appeal s failed.  Finality and certainty 
required that they should live with the consequences  [53]. The assurance to TMR was in no sense 
given at their expense. They had no right to such an assurance.  The OFT’s mistake was that they gave 
the assurance to TMR, not that they failed to give it to the respondents . It was not irrational  for the 
OFT in 2012  to repay the penalty to TMR after the appeal while  not repaying  the respondents , because 
having failed to appeal in reliance on the assurance, TMR would otherwise have been entitled to obtain 
leave to appeal out of time. Since they were in materially the same position as the six successful 
appellants, their appeal would have succeeded.  Therefore, while the  decision was discriminatory, the 
discrimination was objectively justified.  Unlike TMR, the respondents had no basis for a late appeal to 
the CAT [54-56].  
 
Lord Briggs adds that , where a public authority has the option to avoid replicating an earlier mistake 
but at some cost to equal treatment, the choice is one for the authority rather than the court, subject to 
the usual constrains of lawfulness and ra tionality. The OFT’s conduct did not transgress those 
boundaries. The circumstances amount to a powerful objective justification for the unequal treatment: 
(i) the assurance to TMR was a mistake, (ii) its withdrawal in 2012 likely would have left TMR even 
better off than if the assurance were honoured, and (iii) the respondents had neither received nor relied 
upon any similar assurance. On any view the OFT made a rational choice between unpalatable 
alternatives, with which the court should not interfere [62-63].

The Supreme Court unanimously allow s the appeal . Lord Sumption gives the lead judgment, with 
which Lady Hale, Lord Wilson and Lord Lloyd -Jones agree. Lord Briggs gives a concurring judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR  THE JUDGMENT  
 
NOM clauses  are common , for at least three reasons : (i) they prevent attempts , including abusive 
attempts,  to undermine written agreements by informal means; (ii) they avoid disputes not just about 
whether a variation was intended but also a bout its exact terms; (iii) they make it  easier for 
corporations to police  their own internal rules restricting the authority to agree variations . The law of The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Squa re London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 contract does not normally obstruct the legitimate intentions of businessmen, except for overridin g 
reasons of public policy. NOM clauses do not  frustrate or contravene any policy of the law [12]. 
 
The argument for disregarding NOM  clauses  is that  parties cannot agree not to vary a contract orally, 
because such  an agreement would be destroyed automatic ally upon  oral variation . However, there are 
legal systems , including widely  used international codes,  which impose no formal requirements for the 
validity  of contracts  and which yet give effect to NOM  clauses . That  suggest s that there is no 
conceptual inc onsistency between a general rule permitting informally  created  contracts and a specific 
rule requiring variation to be agreed in writing . The same point may be made by reference to the 
treatment of “entire agreement clauses ”, which nullify prior collatera l agreements relating to the same 
subject matter . Where such a clause is relied on to modify  what would otherwise be  the effect of the 
agreement which contains it, the courts will routinely apply the clause according to its terms and will 
decline to give e ffect to the collateral agreement  [13-14]. 
 
Parties who agree an oral variation in spite of a NOM clause do not necessarily intend to dispense with 
that clause. What the parties agreed  was that oral variations will be  invalid, not that they are forbidden . 
The natural inference from a failure to observe a NOM  clause is not that the  parties  intended to 
dispense with it, but that they overlooked it. On the other hand,  if they had it in mind, then they were 
courting invalidity  with their eyes open [15]. 
 
The ap proach of the Court of Appeal overrides the parties’ intentions to bind themselves as to the 
manner in which future changes in their legal relations are to be achieved. In many cases, statute 
prescribes a particular form of agreement. There is no principle d reason why contracting parties should 
not adopt the same prescriptions by agreement [9-11]. 
 
The enforcement of NOM  clauses involves the risk that a party may act on the varied contract but 
then find itself unable to enforce it. The safeguard against inj ustice lies in the various doctrines of 
estoppel. Reliance on an estoppel would require, at  the very least: (i) some words or conduct 
unequivocally representing that the variation was valid notwithstanding its informality and (ii) for this 
purpose , somethi ng more  than the informal promise itself  [16]. 
 
The oral variation in the present case was invalid for want of the writing and signatures required by 
Clause 7.6.  That makes it unnecessary to deal with the issue of consideration. That area of law is 
probabl y ripe for re -examination . The order of the County Court is restored  [17-18]. 
 
Lord Brig gs agrees that the appeal should be allowed, but his reasons differ to those of  Lord 
Sumption . To give effect to a NOM is not to override the parties’ intentions ; the N OM clause wil l 
remain in force until both or all parties agree to do away with it . It is conceptually impossible for the 
contracting parties  to impose upon themselves a particular scheme, but not to be free by further 
agreement to vary or abandon it by any  method  permitted by the general law.  Although various 
international law codes  give effect to NOMs , these either (i) form part of a national law, in which case 
they bind parties as would an English statute, or (ii) have been  chosen by the parties, in which  case the 
parties may agree to depart from th ose principles . Entire agreement clauses a re not a useful analogy : 
they do not purport to bind the parties ’ future conduct, so do not involve the  same conceptual 
difficult ies as NOM clause s. There is a powerful  analogy with negotiations subject to contract, where 
the parties may abandon the requirement of a formal written agreement only expressly or by necessary 
implication. In Lord Briggs’ view, a NOM clause bind s the parties until the y expressly (or by necessar y 
implication) agree to do away with it.  This accords with the analysis adopted in most other common 
law jurisdictions [25-32]. In this case, the oral variation said nothing about the NOM clause , which has 
not been done away with by  necessary  implication [24].

The Supreme Court by a majority of three to two (Lord Reed and Lord Mance dissenting) dismisses  the 
appeal . Lord Kerr gives the main  judgment. Lord Hughes gives a concurring judgment with which Lady 
Black agrees. Lord Reed gives the dissenting judgment, with which Lord Mance agrees.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The appellants  argue that the wording of the Commencement Order is such that where a defendant is 
committed for a number of offences, where any of the offences has been committed before the 
commencement date, then  none of the offences can be dealt with under the 2002 Act.  
 
Lord Kerr observes that his would produce an anomalous result  – the appellants are effectively 
submitting that the jurisdiction of the court to make confiscation orders under the 2002 Act could be 
controlled by tactical decisions by the prosecution  to not proceed with charging offences committed 
before the com mencement date  [11-12]. The overarching consideration is that it was Parliament’s 
intention that (i) offences committed before the commencement date  should not be included in the 
The Supreme Court of  the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 section 156 consideration; and (ii) offences committed after that date which could generate confiscation 
orders under the Act should be dealt with under section 156. It cannot have been intended that a number 
of post -2003 offences should be removed from the scope of the 2002 Act simply because the defendant 
was convicted of an asso ciated offence before the commencement  date [17]. 
 
Further, t he court should seek to avoid an interpretation of the statute which would produce an absurd 
result. Here, the consequence of the 2002 Act being disapplied to a wide range of offences committed 
after the commencement date and requiring them to be dealt with under earlier legislation is undesirable. 
Contemporary cases would have to be dealt with according to standards and rules which have been 
replaced [24-26]. It is not necessary to read words into the statute in order to permit applications for 
confiscation orders for offences committed after the commencement date  [38].  
 
Lord Hughes agrees with Lord Kerr that it is not necessary to read words into the statute to achieve th is 
result [68]. The i ssue depends on whether the offences referred to in s ection  156(2) are all offences or 
only those on which reliance is placed for the purposes of asking the court to make a confiscation order.  
He considers the differences between the earlier legislation an d the 2002 Act and concludes that the key 
question is whether the construction proposed by the Crown would result in any unfairness to the 
defendants. If it would or might, then the principle that penal statutes must be construed strictly in 
favour of thos e penalised would carry considerable weight . There is nothing unfair in saying that the 
appellants  should bear the confiscation consequences of post -March 2003 offences, as required by the 
2002  Act, unless those consequences differ in some way from what they would have been if they had 
not committed  the earlier offences , which they do not  [70-83]. 
 
There is no unfairness caused by any of the differences between the earlier regime and the regime unde r 
the 2002 Act where the 2002 Act regime is applied only to post -commencement offences, because the 
rules which are being applied are those which were in force, and publicly known, at the time the offences 
generating the confiscation order were committed [93-94]. It is not improper for there to be an element 
of election by the Crown in relation to which offences are relied on for the confiscation process [97]. 
 
Although the question of the Court of Appeal’s power to put an error right by substitut ing an ord er did 
not arise given the conclusion, Lord Hughes notes that it ought not to be assumed that there is no such 
power  [108-114]. Lord Kerr agrees with this analysis  [55]. 
 
Lord Reed dissents from the conclusion of the majority and would have allow ed the appea l. His view is 
that the language of the provisions cannot be interpreted as excluding offences which the prosecution 
had elected to leave out of account for the purpose of assessing the benefit obtained by the defendant 
[128] .

The Supreme Court by a majority of three to two (Lord Lloyd -Jones and Lord Briggs dissenting) 
dismisses  the Trust’s appeal . Lady Hale, with whom Lord Wilson and Lady Black agree, give s the main 
judgment and Lady Black adds a further anal ysis of the case -law. T he dissenting judgment is given by 
Lord Briggs , with whom Lord Lloyd -Jones agrees . 
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In the absence of an express contractual provision, the court ha d to determine the implied contractual 
term as to when a notice takes effect. The Trust argued that there was  a common law rule, principally The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 derived from landlord and tenant cases, which provided that notice was given when the letter was 
delivered to its a ddress. Mrs  Haywood relied on the approach of  the Employment Appeal Tribunal 
(EAT) in employment cases to support her case that notice only took effect when it had actually b een 
received by the employee and the employee  had either read or had a reasonable opportunity of reading 
it [12]. 
 
Having reviewed the cases relied on by the parties, the majority held that the approach  which had been  
consistently taken by the EAT was correct because:  
 
• The common law rule in non -employment cases was not as clear and uni versal as suggested. 
Receipt of the notice was always required , and arguably by a person authorised to receive it. 
Even after a statutory  presumption of receipt at the address was  introduced, this was 
rebuttable . 
• The EAT was an expert tribunal familiar wit h employment practices , and with the general 
merits in employment cases . 
• Mrs Haywood’s contract with the Trust was concluded when the EAT  cases were thought to 
represent the general law . 
• There was no reason to suppose that th is approach had cause d any real  difficulties in practice. 
An employer could either make express alternative provision in the contract or ensure notice 
of termination was received in sufficient time to allow the employment  to terminate  on a 
specified  day. 
• It was important for both employ er and employee, even in dismissal on notice cases, to know 
whether and when the employment had  come to an end . The rule should be the same as for 
summary dismissal cases [39]. 
 
Lady Black, agreeing with this conclusion, reviewed the common law cases in fu rther detail to support 
the finding that that these  cases did not have the effect contended for by the Trust [41-75]. Insofar as 
any clear principle emerged , it revolved around delivery to the recipient’s agent, who might be a 
household servant, profession al agent or family member, who would be expected to take in 
communications for the intended recipient as part of their role [73].   
 
Lord Briggs, dissenting, would have found that the common law cases had long established a rule 
embedding an implied term i nto contracts of employment determinable on notice [78]. Such contracts 
were only a sub -species of relationship contracts [79]. The rule for relationship  contracts was that 
written notice of termination was given when the document containing it was duly de livered by hand 
or post to the address of the intended recipient , regardless of whether either the intended recipient or 
his agent was there to receive it [81, 100 ]. The rule had a sensible and even -handed policy objective 
behind it, creating certainty for both parties and representing a fair allocation of risk [118-121].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Briggs gives the lead judgment, with which 
the rest of the Court agrees.  Edmondson are entitled to the enforcement of the traditional equitable lien 
against Haven , as the  client owed a contractual duty to pay the solicitors ’ charges . However,  the equitable 
lien should not have been modernised in the manner undertaken by the Court of Appeal .

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The solicitor ’s equitable lien: the e xisting law 
As the early cases demonstrate , the solicitor’s equitable lien was developed to promote access to justice . 
It enables solicitors to offer litigation services on credit to clients who, although they have a meritorious 
case, lack the financial resources to p ay up front for its pursuit  [1], [33-34].  
 
The equit able lien  depends upon  (i) the client having a liability to the solicitor for his charges ; (ii) there 
being something in the nature of a  fund in which equity can recognise that the solicitor has a claim 
(usually a debt owed by the defendant to the solicitor’s client which owes its existence  to the solicitor’s 
services to the client) ; and (iii) something sufficiently affecting the conscience of the payer  at the time of 
payment , either in the form of collusion with the client to cheat the solicitor or notice or knowledge of 
the solicitor’s claim against or interest i n the fund  [35-37].  
 
Construction of the CFA – does the client have any contractual liability to pay the solicito r’s charges?  
The client care letter,  which explained that the solicitor would be able to recover its costs from the losing 
side if the claimant s won, so that the claimants would not need to put their hands in their own pockets, 
did not mean that the claimants were not contractually liable for the solicitors’ fees . It merely limited the 
recourse from which Edmondson could satisfy that liability to the amount of its  recoveries from the 
defendant, and it both preserved and affirmed the client’s  basic contractual liability . This was a sufficient 
foundation for the lien to operate as a security for paym ent, on a limited recourse basis  [40-44]. 
 
Did Haven have notice of Edmondson’s  lien? 
In all the cases before the court, the requiremen t that the settlement debts must owe their creation to 
Edmondson’s services provided to the claimants under the CFAs was satisfied on the facts. 
Edmondson’s actions in logging the claim on the portal contributed to the settlement in two ways. First, 
it sup plied the details of the claim to the insurer, and second, it demonstrated the claimant’s serious 
intention to pursue the claim , and ability to do so with the benefit of a CFA  [45-46], [59 -63]. 
 
Once a defendant or his insurer is notified that a claimant in a road traffic accident  case has retained 
solicitors under a CFA, and that the solicitors are proceeding under the Protocol, they have the requisite 
notice and knowledge to make a subsequent pa yment of settlement monies direct to the claimant 
unconscionable, as an interference with the solicitor’s interest in the fruits of the litigation .  In this case, 
Haven had notice of the lien because they knew that each of the claimants  had retained Edmond son 
under a CFA , and also knew that Edmondson was looking to the fruits of the claim for recovery of its 
charges  [48-50]. As such,  the lien could be enforced against Haven  by requiring it to pay the fee amounts 
in the CFAs direct to Edmondson, but only up to the amount of the agreed settlement payments  [65].  
To that limited extent the order made by the Court of Appeal needed to be varied.  
 
The re -formulation of the equitable lien by the Court of Appeal  
It is not strictly necessary to address this issue in view of the decision on the traditional principle  above, 
but the correctness or otherwise of the Court of Appeal’s reformulation of the principle has been 
extensively argued , and the Law Socie ty has intervened to support it  [51-52].  
 
There are insuperable  obstacles to extending the principle to cases where , although there is no 
contractual liability for the ch arges, the Protocol is breached . This includes  the fact  that the Protocol is  
purely voluntary and created no debt or oth er relevant legal rights at a ll. Whilst equitable remedies are 
flexible, they still operate according to principle. One of the principles of the equitable lien is that the 
client must have  a responsibility for the solicitor’s charges. There is no general principle that equity will 
protect solicitors from any unconscionable interference with their expectations in relation to recovery 
of their charges  [53-58].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
First principles  
Before consi dering negotiating damages for breach of contract, it is necessary to consider general 
principles relating to user damages in tort, damages in equity, and damages for breach of contract [24]. 
  
(i) User damages in tort : Damages assessed by reference to the value of the use wrongfully made of property, 
measured by what a reasonable person would have paid for the right of user (sometimes termed “user 
damages”) , are readily awarded at common law for the invasion of property rights. Damages are available 
on a similar basis for the invasion of intellectual property rights  [25-30, 95(1) -(2)]. 
 
(ii) Damages in equity under Lord Cairns’ Act: Under section 2 of the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 (“Lord 
Cairns’ Act”) , now re -enacted in  section 50 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 , damages can be awarded in 
substitution for an injunction or specific performance where the court had jurisdiction to grant such a 
remedy when the proceedings were commenced. Damages on this basis are a monetary substitute for 
what is lost by the withholding of the remedy. One method of quantifying damages under this head is 
by reference to the economic value of the right which the court has declined to enforce. Such a valuation 
can be arrived at by reference to t he amount which the claimant might reasonably have demanded in 
return for the relaxation of the obligation in question  [41-47, 95(3) -(5)]. 
 
(iii) Common law damages for breach of contract : Common law damages for breach of contract  are intended to 
place the  claimant in the same position as he would have been in had the contract been performed. They 
are therefore normally based on the difference between the effect of performance and non -performance 
upon the claimant’s situation. Where the breach of a contract ual obligation has caused the claimant to 
suffer loss, that loss should be measured or estimated as accurately and reliably as possible. The law 
tolerates imprecision , and t here are different legal principles which can assist in estimating the claimant’s 
loss [31-40, 95(6) -(9)]. Contract law damages  cannot be awarded merely for the purpose of depriving 
the defendant of profits made as a result of the breach, except  in exceptional circumstances, following 
Attorney General v Blake [2001] 1 AC 268 [35, 73, 82,  95(11)] . Contract law damages are not a matter of 
discretion. They are claimed as of right, and are awarded or refused on the basis of legal principle  [36, 
81, 95(12)] . 
 
Negotiating damages for breach of contract  
Lord Reed  reviews  the Wrotham Park  line of cases  at [48-90], divid ing the case law into two phases. In 
the initial period, beginning with Wrotham Park , awards based on a hypothetical release fee were made in 
the exercise of the jurisdiction under Lord Cairns’ Act in substitution for injunct ions to prevent 
interferences with property rights and breaches of restrictive covenants over land  [49-63]. In the  later 
period, awards calculated in a similar way were made at common law on a wider and less certain basis  
[83-90]. This later phase includes  Experience Hendrix LLC v PPX Enterprises Inc  [2003] EWCA Civ 323.  
Lord Reed expresses some doubts on the  reasoning  of Experience Hendrix , but supports the decision as 
it can be understood on an orthodox basis [89-90]. The two phases are divided by the case of Attorney 
General v Blake , in which the wider availability of hypothetical release fee  awards was signalled, but the 
seeds of uncertainty were sown . However, although Wrotham Park was discussed in Attorney General v  
Blake , negotiating damages were not sought , and were not before the court [64-82].  
 
The discussion  above  leads to the conclusion that n egotiating damages can be awarded for breach of 
contract where the loss suffered by the claimant is appropriately measu red by reference to the economic 
value of the right which has been breached, considered as an asset.  The imaginary negotiation is  merely  
a tool for arriving at that value.  That value may be the measure of loss  where the breach of contract 
results in the loss of a valuable asset created or protected by the right which was infringed , as in the case 
of the breach of a restrictive covenant or an intellectual property agreement . The rationale is that the 
claimant ha s in substance been deprived of a valuable asset, and his loss can therefore be measured by 
determining the economic value of the right in question, considered as an asset. The defendant has taken 
something for nothing, for which the claimant was entitled to require payment [91-93, 95(10)] . 
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
The present case  
Applying these conclusions to the present case, both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal adopted a 
mistaken  approach  [96-97]. The substance of the claimant’s case  is that it suffered financial  loss in the 
form of lost profits and goodwill. Though difficult to quantify, this is a familiar type of loss , which can 
be quantified  in a conventional manner . The claimants did not suffer  the loss of a valuable asset created 
or protected b y the right which wa s infringed.  Accordingly, t he case should be remitted for the judge to 
measure the financial loss which the claimant has actually sustained. If evidence is led in relation to a 
hypothetical release fee, it is for the judge to determine its relevance and we ight, if any. However, such 
a fee is not itself the measure of the claimant’s loss in a case of the present kind  [96-100]. 
 
The other judgments  
Lord Sumption would also allow  the appeal. He  considers that damages based on a notional release fee 
may be awar ded in three categories of cases:  (i) where  the claimant has an interest , such as a property 
right, or the government’s interest in  Attorney General v  Blake , which extends beyond financial reparation 
[110-111]; (ii) where  the claimant would be entitled to the specific enforcement of his right , and the 
notional release fee is the price of non -enforcement  [112-114]; and (iii) where the notional price of a 
release may be relevant as an evidential technique for estimating the claimant’s loss , such as in case s of 
patent infringement  [115-123]. The present case may fall into this third category [106]. Lord Sumption 
would  modify the declaration of the judge accordingly [124] . 
 
Lord Carnwath agrees with Lord Reed’s analysis and takes issue with certain aspects of Lord Sumption’s 
analysis [133-137]. Lord Carnwath also considers the impact of the reasoning on other areas of the law 
concerning compensation for statutory interference  with property rights [138-152], and makes some 
observations on the date of assessment of negotiating damages in different types of case s [153-159].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.  Lord Sumption and Lord Lloyd -Jones give the

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Mr Khrapunov’s first argument was that  contempt of court cannot constitute the required “unlawful 
means” for the tort of conspiracy to cause loss by unlawful means , because contempt is not a wrong 
which by itself entitles a claimant to sue the contemnor: it is not “actionable”.  Therefore, he argued, 
there  was no  good, arguable  case against him  on which to found  jurisdiction  [5].  
 
The tort of conspiracy  can be divid ed into “lawful means” conspiracy and “unlawful means” 
conspiracy, although that terminology is inexact. A person has a right to advance his own interests by 
lawful means , even if the foreseeable consequence is damage to the interests of others . Where he seeks The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 to do so by unlawful means, he has no such right. The same is true where the means are lawful but the 
predominant intention of the defendant  is to injure the claimant , rather than to further some legitimate 
interest of his own . In either case, there i s no just cause or excuse for the “combination”  with others . 
Conspiracy being a tort of primary liability,  rather than simply a form of joint liability,  the question 
what constitute s unlawful means cannot depend on whether their use would give rise to a di fferent 
cause of action  independent of conspiracy. The correct test is whether there is a just cause or excuse 
for the defendants  combining with each other to use  unlawful means . That depends on (i) the nature 
of the unlawfulness ; and (ii) its relationship  with the resultant damage to the claimant  [8-11]. 
 
Unlike various other legal duties, compliance with the criminal law is a universal obligation. The 
unlawful means relied on in this case are contempt of court, which is a criminal offence. For that 
purpos e, the defendant must have intended to damage the bank. The damage to the bank need not 
have been the predominant purpose, but it must be more than incidental. The defendants’ 
predominant purpose in this case was to further Mr Ablyazov’s financial interest s as they conceived  
them  to be. But t he damage to the bank was necessarily intended. Their aim was to prevent the bank 
from enforcing its claims against Mr Ablyazov, and both defendants must have appreciated that the 
benefit to him was exactly concomitant with the detriment to the bank . The damage was not just 
incidental  [15-16].  
 
It was argued on behalf of Mr Khrapunov that the existence of a claim for conspiracy to commit 
contempt of court would be  inconsistent with public policy  because it would substit ute a remedy as of 
right for one which depended on the discretion of the court . The Court is satisfied that there is no 
such public policy  [18-23].  
 
The matters alleged by the bank, if proved, would  amount to the tort of conspiracy to injure by 
unlawful m eans [24]. 
 
Mr Khrapunov’s second argument  was that the English courts lacked jurisdiction  by reason of the 
general rule, in article 2 of the Lugano Convention  to which both the UK and Switzerland are parties , 
that a person should be sued in the Convention  state in which he or she is  domicile d. The sole 
currently relevant exception to that rule is article 5 (3), which allows a claim  in tort in the Convention 
state “where the harmful event occurred or may occur” . Article 5(3) is substantially identical to art icle 
5(3) of the Brussels Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001). The Court of Justice of the 
European Union (“CJEU”) has interpreted the latter to  cover both : (a) the place where the damage 
occurred and (b) the place of the event giving rise to i t [26-28].  
 
As an exception  to the general rul e, article 5(3) must be i nterpreted strictly. Although there  is no basis 
for interpreting it by reference to national rules of non -contractual liability, those national rules are 
relevant . They define the lega lly relevant conduct and whether an event is harmful.  The CJEU has  
repeatedly  focused on  the relevant harmful event which sets the tort in motion . This gives effect to an 
important policy of the Brussels/Lugano scheme by promoting  a connecting factor with the 
jurisdiction  of a court which is particularly close  to the cause of the damage . In Cartel Damage Claims 
(CDC) Hydrogen Peroxide SA v Akzo Nobel NV  (Case C -352/13) [2015] QB 906 the CJEU identified  the 
formation of a cartel , not its implementation , as “the event giving rise to the damage”  [31-40].  
 
The Court of Appeal correctly identified the place where the conspiratorial agreement was made as the 
place of the event which gives rise to and is at the origin of the damage . In entering into the 
agreement,  Mr Khrapunov would have encouraged and procured the commission of unlawful acts by 
agreeing to help Mr Ablyazov to carry the scheme into effect. Thereafter, Mr Khrapunov’s all eged 
dealing with the assets the subject of the court order would have been unde rtaken pursuant to and in 
implementation of that agreement. The making of the agreement should be regarded as the harmful 
event which set the tort in motion  [41].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal . Lady Black gives the sole judgment with which the

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Negligence and breach of statutory duty are not actionable in and of  themselves . It is necessary for 
claimants to establish that there has been damage in the form of actionable personal injury.  No 
decided case provides a definition of actionable personal injury, but there is some guidance as to its 
attributes.  [11-12] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
Person al injury has been seen as : a physical change which makes the claimant appreciably worse of f in 
respect of his health or capability ; as including an injury sustained to a person’s physical capacity of 
enjoying life ; and as an impairment. It can also be hid den and symptomless. [27] 
 
What matters  in this case  is the behaviour of the IgE antibody , which is produced by an individual  
who has developed platinum salt sensitisation. If such an individual is exposed again to platinum salts, 
the IgE antibody is likel y to react in a way which produces allergic symptoms . When an individual 
becomes sensitised, this change to their bod y means that they lose their capacity to work around 
platinum salts. [37] 
 
Respondent ’s counsel  acknowledged that if the Appellants  had developed a sensitivity to something  
encountered  in everyday  life, such as sunlight, they would have sustained actionable damage because 
they would not be able to carry on with their ordinary life. The Appellants’ ordinary li ves involved 
doing jobs of a type which, by virtue of their sensitisation , they can no longer do. This cannot be 
distinguished from  the person who developed a sensitivity to sunlight. [39] 
 
The physiological changes to the Appellants’ bodies are undoubtedly harmful. Cartledge  v Jopling  
establishes that the absence of symptoms does not prevent a condition  amounting to actionable 
personal injury. What has happened to the claimants is that their bodily capacity for work has been 
impaired and they are therefore significantly worse off. [40] 
 
Once the sensitisation is identified as an actionable injury in its own right, the Respondent’s  argument 
that the Appellants  are claiming only for their lost earnings and therefore for pure economic loss also 
falls away. [44] 
 
This case is distinguishable fr om Rothwell v Chemical and Insulating Co Ltd . In that case , the pleural 
plaques the claimants developed were not hing more than a symptomless marker of exposure to 
asbestos dust and would not lead to or contribut e to any condition which would produce sympto ms, 
even with further exposure to asbestos dust. In this case, the Appellants’ sensitisation carries the risk 
of an allergic reaction in the event of further exposure to platinum salts  and they must change their 
lives to avoid such exposure. [47] 
 
In these  circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider the Appellants’ alternative argument that they 
should be able to recover for pure financial loss. [49]

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Article 6 ECHR  provides the right to a fair trial. The relevant provision is article 6.3 (c), which states 
that every person charged with a criminal offence sha ll have the right to defend himself in person or 
through legal assistance of his own choosing. The appellant argued that this entitled him to choose 
which lawyers could defend him, unless the Bar Council could show that the refusal was justified  [18-
21].  
 
The court examined the relevant case law  of the European Court of Human Rights , which emphasises 
adequacy of representation over freedom of choice as to the identity of counsel. The fundamental 
basis of the right guaranteed by article 6.3 (c) is that the legal representation should be conducive to a 
fair trial, rather than conferring complete freedom  to an  individual defendant to choose the lawyer by 
whom to be represented [28]. A defendant does not have the right to decide in what manner his 
defence shoul d be assured  – the right is to be represented by sufficiently experienced counsel of one’s 
choice, but the role to be played by that counsel cannot be dictated by the defendant  [30].  
 
In the present case, the appellant has not advanced any grounds why Mr Barlow should be designated 
as leading counsel so that his rights of defence would be assured. As the respondent has pointed out, 
Mr Barlow could continue to act for Mr Maguire but as junior counsel, either with senior counsel, or, 
if senior counsel was no t available, alone. Mr Maguire was not deprived of the services of Mr Barlow 
by operation of the Bar Council  code of conduct. The deprivation, if there was one, was the denial of 
an enhanced payment to Mr Barlow acting as “leading counsel”  [32]. 
 
The exerc ise involved here is one of the courts deciding what the interests of justice require, not 
whether an interference with an individual’s Article 6  right has been justified. Of course, the wishes of 
a defendant may be pertinent to the question of where the i nterests of justice lie but that is not because 
they have an intrinsic value  [36]. It is clear from the relevant authorities that the essence of the right to 
choose one’s counsel lies in the contribution that the exercise of that right makes to the achieve ment 
of the ultimate goal of a fair trial. It is not an autonomous right which falls to be considered outside 
that context  [38]. 
 
Article 6 does not give a defendant  the right to demand that he have counsel of his choice at public 
expense, independently of  the requirements of the interests of justice. So far from impinging on the 
appel lant’s rights under article 6.3 (c), the relevant provision in the Bar’s code of conduct is designed to 
uphold and vindicate them  [44].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Wilson gives the judgment with which 
Lord Carnwath, Lord Hughes and Lord Hodge agree. Lady Hale gives a concurring judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
An inquiry into whether a dismissal is unfair is governed by s.98 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. 
In summary, t his requires that the employer show (i) that there is a reason for the dismissal, (ii) that 
that reason relates to the employee’s conduct or is si milarly justifiable, and (iii) that they acted 
reasonably in treating the reason as sufficient for the dismissal  [16-18]. On this latter point, i.e. the 
reasonableness of the employer’s conduct, the courts have for many years employed the test set out in 
the case of British Home Stores Ltd v Burchell [1980] ICR 303 [ 19]. This has been considered, in effect, to 
require the tribunal to inquire whether the dismissal was within a range of reasonable responses to the 
reason shown for it, and whether it had been preceded by a reasonable amount of investigation [ 22].  
 
In this case, Ms Reilly  was under a contractual obligation  to assist the governing body in discharging its 
duty to safeguard the pupils , and the question was whether her relationship with Mr Selwood engaged 
the governing body’s safeguarding functions  [25-26]. Parliament has previously recognised (for 
example via the Childcare Act 2006 and the regulations made under it) that sexual offenders towards 
children can represent a danger to children not only directly but also indirectly by operating through 
those with whom the  children  associate . Mr Selwood was the subject of a serious, recent conviction 
and t he basis of his sentence was that he represented a danger to children. As head teacher, Ms Reilly  
was likely to know important information about her pupils, including their whereabouts, their routine 
and their circumstances at home. She was also likely to be able to authorise visitors to enter the school 
premises . Mr Selwood’s relationship with Ms Reilly  therefore created a potential risk to the children  at 
the school . This risk required the assessment of the governors  [27-28]. In these circumstances, the 
employment tribunal was entitled to conclude that it was a reasonable response for the disciplinary 
panel to have concluded that Ms Reilly’s  non-disclosure of her relationship with Mr Selwood not only 
amounted to a breach of duty, but also merited her dismissal . Ms Reilly’s  continuing refusal to accept 
that she had been in breach of her duty suggested a lac k of insight which, it was reasonable to 
conclude, rendered it inappropriate for her to continue to run the school  [29].  
 
Lady Hale’s Concurring Judgment  
 
Lady Hale agrees, and for the reasons given by Lord Wilson, that Ms Reilly  breached her contract of 
employment by not informing her employers of her connection with Mr Selwood . She also agrees that 
Ms Reilly’s  continuing failure to acknowledge that this information should have been disclosed  made 
the decision to dismiss her reasonable [ 31]. Notwithstandi ng this, Lady Hale wishes  to note that th is 
case might, if argued differently, have presented an opportunity for the Supreme Court to consider two 
points of law of general public importance which have not bee n raised at this level before. Namely, (1) 
wheth er a dismiss al based on an employee’s ‘conduct’ can ever be fair if that conduct is not in breach 
of the employee’s contract of employment [ 32], and (2) whether the approach laid down by the 
Employment Appeal Tribunal in British Homes Stores Ltd v Burchell  is correct  [33]. In the absence of any 
such argument, however, the law remains unchanged, and Lady Hale expresses no view as to whether 
that is correct  [35].

The Supreme Court unanimously allo ws the appeal. Lord Carnwath gives the judgment, with which 
Lord Kerr, Lord Reed, Lord Hughes and Lady Black agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Under  paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 6  to the Local Government Finance Act  1988 , the rateable value of 
a non -domest ic hereditament is taken to be “an amount equal to the rent at which it is estimated  the 
hereditament might reasonably be expected to let from year to year” on the basis of certain prescribed  
assumptions .  Prescribed assumptions are set out in the  2000 Regulations  [6]. 
 
The 2000 Regulations are derived from the recommendations of a report by an Expert Advisory 
Committee under the chairmanship of Mr Derek Wood QC (“the Wood Report”) published in 1993. 
The Committee  review ed the law and practice relating to t he rating of plant and machinery, with a 
view to updating and harmonising it throughout the United Kingdom [7]. 
 
The prescribed assumptions under paragraph 2 of the 2000 Regulations include the assumption that  
any plant or machinery , if it belongs to any c lass listed  in the Schedule to the 2000 Regulations , is 
assumed to be part of the hereditament in or on which it is situated.  The classes in the Schedule are in 
effect exceptions to the general rule  that the value of plant and machinery cannot affect the e stimated 
value of the hereditament for rating purposes.  [8]. “Class 2 ” in the Schedule consists of:    
 
“Plant and machinery specified in Table 2 below… which is used or intended to be used in 
connection with services to the hereditament or part of it, other than any such plant or machinery 
which is in or on the hereditament and is used or intended to be used in connection with services mainly or 
exclusively as part of manufacturing operations or trade processes.” (Emphasis added.)  
 
It is common ground that the AHS is covered  by Table 2 and that it is used in connection with 
services  to the hereditament . The only issue is whether the AHS  is excluded from Class 2 by the 
wording  italicised above  (“the Proviso”) [9-10]. 
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The history of the legislation provides useful background to the law as it stood at the time of  the 
Wood Report . Historically, it has been difficult to draw a defensible line between, on the on e hand, 
plant and machinery properly treated as part of the hereditament when assessing its hypothetical  letting 
value, and plant and machinery more fairly attributable to the tenant’s business within it (“the tools of 
the trade”) . Lord Carnwath  traces the development of  the law on the issue in England and in Scotland , 
where the law developed differently , up to the time of the review by the Wood Committee  [12-19]. 
 
The Wood Report accepted the validity “up to a point” of a “tools of the trade” exemption,  subject to 
qualification in the interests of fairness between ratepayers. The Committee  accepted  the “unde rlying 
conceptual approach” of the regulations  in each part of the UK as “soundly based”. It recommended, 
amongst other things, that future regulations be based on  the principle “that process plant and 
machinery which can fairly be described as ‘tools of t he trade’ should be exempt within certain limits” 
[20-22]. The Committee commented specifically on the predecessor in the English regulations to Class 
2, describ ing it as “not free from ambiguity.” They concluded that, despite  such difficulties, “the law a s 
we understand it in both England and Scotland should remain unaltered but that the draftsmanship 
should be improved to eliminate the difficulties inherent in the English Regulations.” Annex L to the 
Report also contained various examples, including that  of “refrigeration plant .” The Committee 
concluded that this  was exempte d and should remain  so under their recommendations [23-24]. 
 
In the Supreme Court the  respondent advanced a broader case than that adopted by the lower courts. 
This broader argument  was that the Proviso  concerned productive activities in industry  only and not  
other commercial activities , such as  Iceland’s  retail activities. This contention was impossible  in view of 
(i) the wording of the 2000 Regulations and  (ii) the background of the Wo od Report . As to the f irst, 
the draftsman could have easily restricted the Proviso to industrial activities, but the inclusion of “trade 
processes”, as an alternative to “manufacturing operations” , instead widens it . The word “trade”  
naturally extends to Iceland’s retail activities. Subject to the meaning  of the word “process”, nothing  in 
the Proviso or its context justif ies a narrower approach [34]. As to the second,  the respondent’s broad 
contention was inconsistent with the Wood Report, which emphasised  “the principle of fairness 
between ratepayers” . No such limitation was proposed in the discussion of what became Class 2.  Its 
proposed rules included a “the tools of the trade”  exemption , without limiting  the nature of that trade . 
Its proposed rule dealing  with the need to draw lines between “service” and “process ” functions was 
expressed  in general terms  [35]. The respondent’s contention was even harder to reconcile with the 
Scottish legislation, which referred to “any trade, business or manufacturing proc ess” and which the 
Wood Report criticised  for not going far enough [36].  
 
Turning to the reasoning of the  Court of Appeal and the Upper Tribunal , both saw the Proviso  as an 
exception to be construed narrowly; and as referring to a process designed to brin g about a 
“transition” from one state to another . That pays insufficient regard to the place of the Proviso within  
the scheme of the  regulations as a whole : it is and always was an exception to an exception . It brings 
items of plant back into the scope  of the general rule. The rationale is that, although they may provide 
a service to the building, their main or exclusive function is to  provide a service to the activities of the 
trader within it . They are therefore more fairly considered as “tools of the tra de” [37]. Nothing in the 
Wood Report suggest s that changes of language  in the relevant provisions over time were intended to 
signal any substantive change . On the contrary, the intention was to retain the law substantially without 
alteration , while improvi ng its draftsmanship  [38].  
 
There is nothing in the word “process” itself implying  a transition or change. It has various meanings . 
In its widest sense , it includes  anything done to goods and materials . A “trade process” is simply a 
process (in that wide sense) carried on for the purposes of a trade [39]. In the context of Iceland’s 
trade, the word is apt to cover the continuous freezing or refrigeration of goods to preserve them 
artificial ly. Since the services provided by the relevant plant have been hel d to be used “mainly or 
exclusively” as part of that trade process, they should be lef t out of account for rating purposes [40].

outset . The Court declines to express a final view on section 32.  Lord Briggs gives the judgme nt, with 
which the rest of the C ourt agrees.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Section 21  
For the purpose s of section 21, t he Defendants are regarded as trustees , because  they are entrusted with 
the stewardship of the company’s property and owe fiduciary duties to the company in respect of that 
stewardship . The  company is  regarded as  the beneficiary of the trust under section 21 [11]. 
 
Cont rary to the Defendants’ submissions, s ection 21(1)(b ) does not become  inapplicable merely because 
the misappropriated property has remained legally and beneficially owned by corporate vehicles, rather 
than having become  vested in law or in equity in the de faulting directors  [16].  
 
The purpose of  section 21(1)(b) , as laid down in In re Timmis, Nixon v Smith  [1902] 1 Ch 176  and JJ 
Harrison (Properties) Ltd v Harrison [2002] 1 BCLC 162 , is to give a trustee the benefit of the lapse of time 
when, although he had done something legally or technically wrong, he had done nothing morally wrong 
or dishonest . It is not intended to protect him where, if he pleaded the statute, he would come off with 
something he ought not to have  [17].  
 
Section 21 is prima rily aimed  at express trustees  and is applicable to company directors by a process of 
analogy.  An express trustee  might or might not from time to time be in possession or receipt of the trust 
property  [18]. By contrast, i n the context of company property, directors are to be treated as being in 
possession of the trust property from the outset . It is precisely because, under the typical constitution 
of an English company, the directors are the fiduciary stewards of the company’s property, that they are 
trustees within  the meaning of section 21 . If their misappropriation of the company’s property amounts 
to a conversion of it to their own use, they will necessarily have previously received it, by virtue of being 
the fiduciary stewards of it as directors  [19].  
 
In relat ion to trus tees who are company directors,  it may be that the requirement in section 21(1)(b)  that 
the property be “previously received ” by them  adds little or nothing to the other conditions for the 
disapplication of the limitation period . However,  that requirement is not redundant  in relation to trustees  
generally [20]. 
 
On the assumed facts of the present case, the Defendants converted the company’s shareholding in Vital 
when they procured or participated in the unlawful distribution of it to BHUH . By the time of that 
conversion the defendants had previously received the property because, as directors of the Claimant , 
they had been its fid uciary stewards from the outset [22].  
 
Section 32  
In-depth analysis of the section 32  issue would take the cour t into a minefield of difficulties.  It is not 
necessary to decide this point because of the recent plea of fraud , and because of this court’s decision 
about the meaning of section 21 , which mean  the issue is unsuitable for  summary judgment . Accordingly 
the court express es no  view on the correctness of the Court  of Appeal’s approach to section 32(2)  [26].

REASONS FOR THE J UDGMENT  
 
The starting point , when considering whether someone  is liable for a careless misrepresentation which 
causes economic loss , is the case of Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465 . What 
lay at the heart of that decision  was the need, in order for the representor  to be liable,  for the 
representee reasonably to have relied on the representation , and for the representor reasonably to have 
foreseen that he would do so  [18-19].  
 
However, it has since become  clear that not all claims in tort for losses resulting from  careless 
representations c an easily be resolved by reference to this concept  of assumption of responsibility . 
This was what prompted Lord Griffiths, in Smith v Eric Bush; Harris v Wyre Forest District Council  [1990] 
1 AC 8 31, to propo se a threefold test that required  (1) that it was foreseeable that, were the 
information given negligently, the claimants would be likely to suffer damage; (2) that there was a 
sufficiently proximate relationship between the parties; and (3) th at it was just and reasonable to 
impose the liability [ 20-21]. This test was considered in Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605, 
and for many years the court in Caparo was considered to have indorsed it. However, as has already 
been explained by  the Supreme Court in other recent cases,  the court’s decision in Caparo  was actually 
more nuanced  than has often been allowed , and in fact  the case  is notable for its reassertion of the 
need for it to be reasonable for the representee to have relied on th e representation, and for the 
representor to have reasonably foreseen that they would so  rely [22-23].  
 
Indeed , it is now clear that this concept of assumption of responsibility remains the foundation of 
liability  for a careless misrepresentation , althoug h the concept  may sometimes require cautious 
incremental development in order to fit cases to which it does not readily apply  [24]. Such 
development is unnecessary here, however, as the concept fits the case perfectly [ 25]. Consideration of 
six relevant au thorities demonstrate s that a solicitor will not assume responsibility towards the opposite 
party unless it was reasonable for the latter to have relied on what the solicitor said , and unless the 
solicitor should reasonably have for eseen that the opposite party  would actually rely on the statement . 
These ingredients of reasonable reliance and foreseeability are particularly relevant to a claim against a 
solicitor by the opposing party, because it is presumed to be inappropriate for a solicitor to assume 
such a responsibility towards the other side [32].  
 
In this case, the Lord Ordinary had found that Ms Steel generally expected NRAM to check her 
requests before complying with them, and therefore that she had not foreseen that  they would rely on 
her assertio ns without checking their accuracy. In addition, any prudent bank taking basic precautions 
would have checked the accuracy of such statements, and it was therefore not reasonable for NRAM 
to have  relied  on the email  [33].  
 
The majority of the Inner House however had disagreed,  and held that there were certain 
circumstances which led to the conclusion that Ms Steel had assumed responsibility for the 
representations in the email , such that the court did not even need to consider whether NRAM should 
have chec ked its file . These circumstances included , amongst other things,  Ms Steel’s area of expertise,  
and the fact the NRAM had not instructed solicitors [ 34]. The approach of the majority  was, however,  
incorrect. Nothing in the relevant case law supports a conc lusion that it is not always necessary for a 
representee to show that it was reasonable of it to have relied on the relevant representation. This is an 
essential  element  of the concept of assumption of responsibility  [35].  Moreover, t he Lord Ordinary 
was correct to find that a commercial lender about to implement an agreement re lating  to its security 
does not act reasonably if it proceeds upon no more than a description of the agreement’s terms put 
forward by the borrower [ 38].

The Supreme Court dismisses  the appeal  by a majority of three to two. Lord Sumption, with whom 
Lord Wilson and Lord Carnwath agree, gives the lead judgment . Lady Hale  and Lord Briggs  dissent.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
What constitutes “good reason” for validating the non -compliant service of a c laim form is essentially 
a matter of factual evaluation . The main factors, the weight of which will vary with the circumstances, 
are likely to be: (i) whether the claimant took reasonable steps to serve  in accordance with the rules; (ii) 
whether the defend ant or his solicitor knew  of the contents of the claim form when it expired; (iii) 
what, if any, prejudice the defendant would suffer from validation of the non -compliant service [9-10]. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
It cannot be enough that Mr Barton’s email  brought the claim form to Berrymans’  attention. That is 
likely to be necessary for validation but it is not sufficient. Rules of court must identify a formal step to 
be treated as informing  the defendant of the contents of the claim form . A clear and precise  rule is 
necessary : (i) to determine the exact point from which time  limits  run for the taking of further steps , or 
the entry o f judgment in default of them , and (ii) because valid service of the claim form may have 
significant implications for the operation of any relevant limi tation period, as in this case. 
Consequently it has never been enough that the defendant is aware of the contents of the claim form  
[15-16]. Moreover,  particular problems are associated with electronic service. A  solicitor must have his 
client’s authority to accept service , which  normally in practice cover s any mode of service . But  a 
solicitor’s office must be properly set up  to receive  and monitor  formal electronic communications , 
which can arrive unnoticed  and in the absence of the person primarily respon sible for the matter  [17]. 
 
Unless the rules and  practice directions are particularly inaccessible or obscure, it is reasonable to 
expect a litigant in person to familiar ise himself with the rules which apply to any step he is about to 
take. Rule 6.3 and P ractice Direction 6A , to which Mr Barton did not in fact refer,  are not inaccessible 
and obscure.  They do not justify his assumption that Berrymans would accept service by email unless 
they said otherwise. Others have made the same  mistake  as Mr Barton , but not for want of clarity in 
the rules [18-19]. By June 2013 Mr Barton was an experienced litigant. He knew about limitation. He 
knew that not all solicitors accepted service by email. Yet he took no steps to check whether 
Berrymans did so, or to ascertain  the rules on service by email  [19-20]. A claimant need not necessarily 
show  that compli ant service was impossible . It is enough that he has taken such steps  as are 
reasonable. In this case the problem was that Mr Barton made no attempt to serve in accorda nce with 
the rules. All that he did was employ a mode of service which he should have appreciated was not in  
accordance with the rules [21]. The contention that Berrymans , by raising this issue , had been “playing 
technical games” does not advance Mr Barton ’s case: they did nothing before the purported service to 
suggest that they would not raise it [22]. None of this would have mattered if Mr Barton had allowed 
himself time to rectify any mishap. But having issued the claim form at the very end of the limit ation  
period , and having made no attempt to serve it until the very end of its period of validity, he can have 
only a very limited claim on the court’s indulgence under rule 6.15(2).  By comparison, validation of 
service would prejudice Wright Hassall by de priving them of a n accrued  limitation defence [23]. 
 
There is no merit in the contention that the outcome  in the lower courts is incompatible with Mr 
Barton’s right to a fair trial under article 6 of the  European Convention on Human Rights. The 
relevant ru les are sufficiently accessible and clear . They  serve a legitimate purpose. The Limitation Act, 
not those rule s, prevented  Mr Barton from  pressing  his claim. A reasonable limitation period does not 
contravene article 6 [24]. Lord Sumption agrees with Lord Briggs that the Civil Procedure Rule 
Committee should look at the issues dealt with on this appeal , but the appeal is dismissed [25].  
 
Lord Briggs , with whom Lady Hale agrees, would have allowed the appeal for the following reasons. 
The most important purp ose of service is to ensure that the contents  of the claim form are brought to 
the attention of the person to be served . A second important purpose is  to notify  the recipient that the 
claim has been commenced against the defendant, and on a particular day . The provisions in P ractice 
Direction 6A  regulating service by email are to ensure that recipients have the opportunity to put in 
place arrangements for monitoring and dealing with what was then a new mode of service  [28-29]. 
Where all three of those  purpo ses are achieved, that i s a good reason for validating service under r ule 
6.15 provid ed that there are no t sufficient  adverse factors  against it , which might include  a deliberate 
failure to comply or professional negligence  [30]. The power to validate serv ice is not limited to cases 
where an independent  “good reason”  is identified , beyond satisfaction of those underlying purposes 
[32-35]. Mr Barton’s attempted service fully achieved those purposes . That provides  good reason for 
validat ion unless the circums tances swing the balance against it. Aspects of the circumstances may be 
said to point both ways . Berrymans’ loss of its accrued limitation defence does not militate against 
validation: the acquisition of the defence would have been a windfall. Taking all the relevant 
considerations into account, Mr Barton’s attempt at service by email should be validated [38-43].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The main area of dispute is the nature of the positive obligation  impose d by article 3 of the ECHR, 
particularly the issue of whether the obligation  relates only to  systemic  failures or whether it also includes 
operational  failures  [6].   
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Lord Kerr  examine s the ECHR case law supporting the existence of the positive obligation  under article 3  
and conclude s that t here is a n operational duty  to conduct a proper inquiry into behaviour amounting to a 
breach of article 3  [20, 54-58].  
 
In order to be an effective deterrent, laws which prohibit conduct constituting a breach of articl e 3 must be 
rigorously enforced and complaints of such conduct must be properly investigated [24]. Deficiencies in 
investigations do not have to be part of a flawed approach of the system generally for a breach of article 3 
to arise . It is clear, however, that errors must be serious in order to give rise to  such a breach [29-30].  The 
ECtHR case law demonstrates a clear and constant line of authority to the effect that the state has a duty to 
conduct an effective investigation into crimes involving serious violence to the individual [44-48]. It has 
consistently been held that the positive obligation to investigate effectively is not solely confined to cases of 
ill-treatment by state agents [59-62]. 
 
Lord Neuberger agrees with Lord Kerr that serious failures which are purely operational will suffice to 
establish a claim . ECtHR case law supports  this approach . There is no basis in that case law for the 
suggestion that the investigatory duty should be limited to systemic, as opposed to operational, failures [85, 
93]. 
 
Lord Hughes  differs from this view in that he considers there is a positive obligation to ensure that there 
are appropriate legal structures in place but that there is no operational obligation. ECtHR case law leaves 
uncertainty as to the source and  extent of the investigative duty [117] . The proper test for the positive 
obligation under article 3 to investigate reports of past violence is whether the state has a proper structure 
of legal and policing provision designed to punish it when it occurs an d has administered that structure in 
good faith and with proper regard for the gravity of the behaviour under consideration. The test is not 
whether the investigation was careless or involved mistakes which ought not to have been made  [127] . 
There is a bre ach of the positive obligation in this case as there were plain structural errors [140] . 
 
Lord Kerr considers that the fact that the police do not have a common law duty of care in tort does not 
extend to claims advanced under the Human Rights Act 1998 (HR A). The bases of liability are different 
and no assumption should be made that the policy reasons which underlie the exemption of police from 
common law liability apply in the same way to liability for breach of HRA obligations . The existence of a 
duty to investigate effectively does not depend on whether it is fair, just or reasonable to impose one [67-
70].  
 
Lord Hughes takes a different view and  examines  the public policy reasons why English law does not 
recognise a duty of care owed in tort by the polic e to individual citizens . Law enforcement and the 
investigation of alleged crime involve a complex series of judgments and discretionary decisions – to re -
visit such matters step by step by way of litigation with a view to private compensation would inhibi t the 
robust operation of police work . Eng lish law cannot control the operation of the ECHR, but there is a 
delicate balance to be struck and it is undesirable to permit detailed review of a particular criminal 
investigation by way of the ECHR , which is wh y the positive obligation should be confined to structural 
failings  [131-132, 134].  
 
Lord Mance considers that the distinction between operational and systemic failures has been replaced by a 
distinction between simple errors/isolated omissions and more s erious failings , and emphasises that the 
positive obligation under article only relates to more serious failings  [151] .

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 The application of A1P1, in circumstances comparable in some respects to the present, was considered 
by the Court of Appeal in R (Trailer and Marina (Leven) Ltd) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs [2005] 1 WLR 12 67 [19]. In Trailer and Marina , Neuberger LJ referred  to the decision of the 
Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights ( “ECtHR ”) in Sporrong & Lonnroth v Sweden 
(1982) 5 EHRR 85 for the proposition that, irrespective of whether an interference wi th property rights 
can be classified as a deprivation or a control of use under A1P1, it may be necessary to consider whether 
a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interests of the community and the 
requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights [20]. An authoritative summary of 
the principles is found in the Grand Chamber ECtHR decision of Hutten -Czapska v Poland (2007) 45 
EHRR 4  which held that in each case involving an alleged violation of A1P1 the court must  ascertain 
whether by reason of the state’s interference the person concerned had to bear a disproportionate and 
excessive burden [22]. 
 
The issues arising in th is appeal were : (i) whether the conditions imposed by the Agency amounted to 
control or de facto expropriation under A1P1 , (ii) if the former, did the “fair balance” require 
compensation to be paid , and (iii) if the latter, were the re any exceptional circumstances justifying the 
absence of compensation [27].  
 
The Agency submitted that the re strictions in question were clearly a control  of use of Mr Mott’s 
property . As to whether a fair balance had been struck , the Agency referred to its important 
responsibilities with respect to protection of the environment , a factor emphasised in the ECtHR case 
law [28-30]. Mr Mott submitted that the effect of the conditions was to nullify the practical use of his 
lease, and thus amounted to expropriation. Even if the conditions were regarded as a control o f use, the 
courts below were entitled to find that t hey required Mr Mott to shoulder an excessive and 
disproportionate burden, such that breach of A1P1 could only be prevented by payment of 
compensation [31].  
 
The Court found that that the  distinction between expropriation and control under ECtHR case law is 
neither clear -cut nor crucial to the present analysis. It is necessary to consider whether the effect on the 
particular claimant  was excessive and disproportionate [32]. The Agency was correct to emphasise the 
special importance of environmental protect ion but this does not detract from the need to draw a fair 
balance, nor from the potential relevance of compensation  [33].  
 
Against the background of the ECtHR  case law, the Court was unable to fault the judge’s analysis of the 
applicable legal principles in this case [34-36].  The fact that the conditions imposed by the Agency were 
closer to deprivation than mere control was clearly relevant to the fair balance . The Agency gave no 
consideration to the particular impact on Mr Mott’s livelihood, which was severe. The judge suggested 
that the lease retained “some small value” if sold for leisure rather than commercial use but this was 
doubtful and did not consider restrictions on Mr Mott’s ability to transfer his interest in the lease  [36]. 
 
In upholding the decision of the courts below, the Court emphasised that this was an exceptional case 
on the facts, because of the severity and the disproportion (as compared to  others) of the impact on Mr 
Mott. The national authorities have a wide margin of discretion in the imposition of necessary 
environmental controls, and A1P1 gives no general expectation of compensation for adverse effects. 
Furthermore, where (unlike this c ase) the authorities have given proper consideration to the issues of 
fair balance, the courts should give weight to their assessment [37].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
It was submitted on behalf of Susana that she fell within the definition of ‘family member’  under a rticle 2.2(c) of 
the Directive, w hich referred to ‘direct descendants who are under the age of 21’, and as such was entitled to 
move with and reside with Mr and Mrs M. Alternatively, she came within the discretionary provisions of article 
3.2(a) as ‘any other family members, irrespective of their nationality, not falling under the definition in point 2 of 
article 2 who, in the country from which they have come, are dependants or members of the household of the 
Union citizen’ .  
 
The transposition of Article 3.2(a) into Regulation 8 of the R egulations dealing with ‘extended family members’ 
was inaccurate insofar as it imposed a requirement that the dependant or member of the household be a 
‘relative’ of the EEA national [7]. The Supreme Court had little doubt that Susana would fall within art icle 
3.2(c) if she did not fall within article 2.2(c). The term ‘family member’ is wide enough to include people who 
are not related by consanguinity or affinity, and is clearly capable of including a child for whom the Union 
citizen has parental responsib ility under the law of the child’s country of origin [17]. 
 
UK legislation relating to foreign adoptions was relevant to the examination of whether to exercise the 
discretion to facilitate entry and residence. Refusal would in principle be justified if the re were reason to believe 
the child was the victim of exploitation, abuse or trafficking, or that the claims of the birth family had not been 
respected [18], but the fact that the arrangements did not comply in every respect with the stringent 
requirements  of UK adoption law would not be determinative [19]. The best interests of the child were a 
primary consideration, and would depend on factors such as what would have happened to her if the kefalah 
arrangement had not been established , the background and h ow well integrated into the family and household 
she now was [20]. The purpose of the Directive to strengthen the  right of free movement was a further 
consideration  [21]. 
 
There was also reason to consider that Susana qualified for automatic rights of entr y and residence as a direct 
descendant. This was an autonomous term in EU law and require d a uniform interpretation throughout the 
Union [25]. It was not clear from existing case law whether a child in Susana’s position should fall within article 
2.2. The procedural safeguards and provisions against ‘abuse of rights’ in the Directive might be ineffective to 
prevent a child being the victim of exploitation, abuse or trafficking [31], whether that child was a third country 
national or a national of another me mber state [32]. Accordingly, the Supreme Court refers three questions to 
the CJEU for a preliminary ruling:  
 
(1) Is a child who is in the permanent legal guardianship of a Union citizen or citizens, under ‘kefalah’ 
or some equivalent arrangement provided for in the law of his or her country of origin, a ‘direct 
descendant’ within the meaning of article 2.2(c) of the Directive?  
(2) Can other provisions in the Directive, in particular articles 27 and 35, be interpreted so as to deny 
entry to such children if they ar e the victims of exploitation, abuse or trafficking or are at risk of 
such?  
(3) Is a member state entitled to enquire, before recognising a child who is not the consanguineous 
descendant of the EEA national as a direct descendant under article 2.2(c) , into whe ther the 
procedures for placing the child into the guardianship or custody of that EEA national was such as 
to give sufficient considerat ion to the best interests of that  child?  
 
On the question of jurisdiction, Sala had rightly been overruled by the Court of Appeal in a subsequent decision 
on the interpretation of regulation 26 of the Regulations. Susana did enjoy a right of appeal  in respect of both 
articles 2.2  and 3.2 [34-41].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Issue 1  
 
When considering the general scheme of the Abduction Convention, the construction that summary return is 
available if, by the time of the act relied on as a wrongful removal or retention, a child is habitually resident in the 
state where the application for return is made  is unpersuasive . That construction is inconsistent with the operation 
of the Abduction Convention since 1980  and its treatment by subsequent international legal  instruments . [19]  
 
The Abductio n Convention is designed to provide a summary remedy which negates the pre -emptive force of 
wrongful removal or retention and to defeat forum -shopping.  [21] The point of the sch eme adopted by the 
Abduction Convention was to leave the merits to be decided by the courts of the place of the child’s habitual 
residence. If the forum state  is the habitual residence of the child, there can be no place for a summary return to 
somewhere else,  without a merits -based decision . This understanding of the scheme of the Abduction Convention 
is reflected in the provisions of both the Revised Brussels II Regulation and the 1996 Hague Convention on 
Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of  Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection 
of Children . [23]  
 
The Abduction Convention cannot be invoked if by the time of the alleged wrongful act, whether by removal or 
retention, the child is habitually resident in the state where the request for return is lodged. In such a case, that 
state has primary jurisdiction to decide  on the merits , based on the child’s habitual residence, and there is no room 
for a man datory summary decision. [34] 
 
Issue 2  
 
Repudiatory retention has been recognised in some jurisdictions , but no generally accepted international practice 
or authority exists on the point . [39] The desirability of inducing a prompt change of mind in the retaining parent 
is an argument for recognising a repudiatory retention when and if it occurs. The 12 month time limit  for seeking 
mandatory summary return runs from the point a repudiatory  retention occurs and that period may pass before 
an applicant is aware of the repudiatory retention. However, it is not a limitation period but a provision in the 
child’s interest  to limit mandatory summary return. Once elapsed it renders a summary return discretionary.  The 
concer n that repudiatory retention would make Abduction Convention  applications  longer and more complicated  
is a point well made. However, Family Division judges are used to managing applications actively  and controlling 
any tendency to spill outside the relevant issues . Further, if repudiatory retention  require s an over t act or statement , 
this lessens the danger of speculative applications. [46-48] 
 
Repudiatory retention is possible in law. The objections to it are insubstantial , whereas the arguments in favour  
are convincing and conform to the scheme  of the Abduction Convention. It would be unwise to attempt an 
exhaustive definition of proof or evidence. An objectively identifiable act of repudiation is required , but it need 
not be communicated to the left -behind parent  nor does an exact date need to be identifiable . [50-51]  
 
On the  present  facts there could not have been a wrongful retention  in April 2016 as the mother’s internal thinking 
could not by itself a mount to such. If she had such an intention in November 2015, the application to the 
immigration authorities could have amount ed to a repudiatory retention. But it was open  to the judge to believe 
the mother’s evidence that she did not possess  this intenti on in November. [55] There is no basis in law for 
criticising the judge’s decision as to habitual residence.  [57] 
 
Lord Kerr dissents  on the outcome of this case on its facts . He expresse s misgivings about repudiatory retention 
requiring an overt act by the travelling parent.  [63] The judge’s finding that wrongful retention did not arise in 
this case could not be reconciled with his statement that the mother had concluded by April 2016 that she and 
the children should remain in England. [68] Moreover, th e judge’s conclusion that the mother had not formed 
any intention to retain the children in England in November 2015 is insupportable as he failed to address the 
question of what bearing the letter of November 2015 had on her intention.  [72]  
 
Lord Wilson also dissents  on the outcome of this case on its facts . The solicitor’s letter to the immigration 
authorities in November 2015 rep resented a major obstacle to any finding that the mother had not by then 
intended to keep the children in the UK  indefinitely . The judge’s finding as to the mother’s intention in November 
2015 was flawed and the Court of Appeal were correct to order a  fresh inquiry into her intention . [91-92]

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lady Black gives the sole judgment with which

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
On an a ppeal under s .24 of the 1974 Act, the tribunal is entitled to take into account all the available 
evidence relevant to the state of affairs at the time of the service of the prohibition notice, including 
information coming to light after it was served. [24] 
 
It is vital for inspectors to be able to take prompt and effective action to ensure compliance with the 
provisions of the 1974 Act. A prohibition notice is a powerful tool in the inspector’s hands. It not only 
allows an inspector to step in when he is o f the opinion that a particular activity will involve a risk of 
serious personal injury , it also encourages employers to have good systems in place  to improv e public The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 safety. [12] However, the service of a prohibition notice on a business has the potential to do financial 
and reputational harm to it.  [13] 
 
The answer to the issue of what information the tribunal is entitled to take into account when forming 
its view of the facts at the material time is not clear from the wording of s .24 and must be considere d 
in the light of the statutory scheme as a whole . [17] 
 
An appeal against an inspector’s  notice is not against the inspector’s opinion but against the notice 
itself. The tribunal in the present case had  to decide  whether the stairways to the helideck were  so 
weakened by corrosion as to give rise to a risk of serious personal injury.  There is no good reason for 
confining the tribunal’s consideration to the material that was, or should have been, available to the 
inspector. The tribunal  must be entitled to h ave regard to other evidence which assists  in ascertaining  
what the risk in fact was . If the evidence  shows that there was no risk at the material time, then the 
notice  will be modified or cancelled as the situation requires . [18]   
 
It is no cri ticism of the inspector when new material leads to  a different conclusion about risk from the 
one he reached. His decision is often  taken as a matter of urgency and without the luxury of 
comprehensive information. [19] The effectiveness  of a notice  is in no way redu ced by an appeal 
process which enables the realities of the situation to be examined by a tribunal with the benefit of 
additional information. [20] This wider interpretation of s.24 does not undermine the role of 
prohibition  and improvement notices in enco uraging employers to have robust systems in place to 
demonstrate easily that no risk exists and therefore avoid the disruption of a prohibition notice which 
remains in force during the appeal process unless suspended by the tribunal. [21] 
 
The appellant’s arguments , that permitting the tribunal to look beyond the material available to the 
inspector will create delay and cost , do not change the conclusion on the wider interpretation of s .24. 
The appeal must be started within 21 days and will thereafter be un der the control of the tribunal. [22] 
 
There are potent considerations in favour of the  wider interpretation of s.24. The only means by which 
a notice can be cancelled under the statutory scheme is an appeal. However, if the appellant’s 
interpretation were correct a notice could not be disl odged even if the perceived risk of injury never in 
fact existed. In some cases,  an employer might have to carry out unnecessary works. Further,  even if , 
upon receipt of convincing evidence there was no risk  the inspector  would not seek to enforce the 
notice , the notice would still have the capacity  to damage the reputation of the employer and his ability 
to do business. Furthermore, it  cannot be right  in those circumstances  that an employer should be  
exposed to the possib ility of criminal proceedings after his appeal is concluded . [23]

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal , although  for reasons other than those given by 
the Inner House . Lord Sumption gives the judgment, with which Lady Hale, Lord Reed, Lord Hodge 
and Lady Black agree.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The refusal of Ms Romein’s citizenship application , notwithstanding  the assumption  in section 4C , on 
the ground  that the consular staff would have properly refused to register her birth  is a paradoxical 
result , calling for scrutiny  [3]. There  are logically only three possible solutions  to this conundrum [9]. 
 
The first approach is that  Section 4C requi res one to assume not only that the law  had always provided 
for citizenship by descent through  the female line, but that consular officials at the time in fact acted 
on that basis. This is Ms Romein’s case, which the Inner House substantially adopted  [9(1) ]. This 
involves formidable difficulties . First, the counterfactual assumption that the consular officials would 
have registered the birth is inconsistent with section 4C(3D) , according to which “it is not to be 
assumed ” that the registration  requirement  was met. The Court cannot accept  the view of the Inner 
House  that section 4C (3D) serves only to cast on the applicant the burden of proving his her of claim 
without  the assistance of any presumption of fact.  Subsection (3D) does not say that.  Moreover, the 
applicant would bear the burden of proving his or her claim anyway . Second , there is a conceptual 
problem about making the operation of section 4C dependent on an enquiry conducted years later into 
the question  of whether a parent would  have wished or inte nded or attempted to take advantage  of a 
then non -existent  right. Third, if the counterfactual assumption includes  an assumption a bout the steps 
which the parents would have taken  with a view to obtaining British citizenship for their children , then 
it wou ld be open to an applicant to  seek citizenship by descent on the basis that the mother would 
have moved to a British -controlled territory for the birth , or that a parent would have entered or 
continued in Crown service in time for the birth . It seems extre mely unlikely that Parliament expected  
the operation of section 4C  to depend on that practically unanswerable question.  Subsection (3D)  
appears to have been added precisely to rule out such unrealistic enquiries [10].  
 
The second approach  is that s ection 4C requires one to assume only that the law had always provided 
for citizenship by descent, but not to make any assumption that the facts were other than they actually 
were. Th is is the Advocate General’s  case, which the Lord Ordinary  substantially adopted . This 
accords with the literal words of section 4 C, bu t its result is that  citizenship by descent through the 
female line would be available under section 5(1)(b) of the 1948 Act only where persons  were 
registered by mistake or in defiance of the regulati ons. It is difficult to see why Parliament should have 
intended to help only them . The Court cannot accept the suggestion that the intention behind  section 
4C was to allow claims to citizenship by descent from  a woman  only in cases where  citizenship 
follow ed automatically from certain specified circumstances and was not dependent on a person taking 
steps , such as registering  a birth. Section 4C  as drafted  would be an extraordinary way of doing  that. 
Parliament is highly unlikely to have had any such  intenti on. It would have significantly undermined 
the purpose of section 5(1)(b) of the 1948 Act for no discernible  reason  [9(2)-11]. 
 
The solution is  to treat the registration condition in section 5(1)(b) as inapplicable  in applications for 
citizenship by descen t from the mother . This is the only way to give effect to section 4C (3), given that 
section 4C(3D) precludes any counterfactual assumption that the birth was registered  [9(3) -12].  
 
There are  two objections to this solution . The Court accepts neither . The first is that it is said to  lead 
to unacceptable discrimination between those born before and after the 1948 Act came into force . The 
Court prefers not to decide this point . It does not affect Ms Romein’s case . It is enough to point out  
that, if  there is a ny difference between the treatment of those two categories  of people , it arises from 
the wording of the 1981 Act (as amended)  [13-14]. The second objection is that this solution leads to a 
different form of gender discrimination, because claimants through  the female line would be free of 
the registration condition whereas claimants through the male line under the previous law were not. 
This is not anomalous  either : there is no  current  discrimination between applicants. There was historic 
discrimination bet ween their parents . Section 4C simply corrects  the remaining consequences  [13, 15].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Lloyd -Jones gives the lead judgment with which 
the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The so -called Hardial Singh  principles concerning the operation of the detention power contained in 
paragraph 2  of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act form an important part of the background to this appeal . These 
principles are that (i) the Secretary of State must intend to deport the perso n and can only use the  detention  
power for that purpose; (ii) the deportee may only be detained for a reasonable period; (iii) if it becomes 
apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within a reasonable period then he 
should not seek to exercise the power of detention ; and (iv) the Secretary of State should act with reasonable 
diligence and expedition to effect removal [24-25]. 
 
At the heart of the case is a dispute about what  the correct approach to the availability of imm igration bail  is 
when the Hardial Singh  limit on actual detention is reached.  The Secretary of State suggested  that a purposive 
interpretation of the legislation should apply so that bail is available regardless of whether the individual is 
lawfully detained or would hypothetically be lawfully detained [28]. The Court saw no basis for such an 
approach. It is a fundamental principle of the common law that Parliament is presumed not to i ntend to 
interfere with the liberty of the subject without making such an intention clear. This was a situation where 
the principle of legality was in play. Accordingly, the Court was required to interpret the statutory provisions 
strictly and restrictivel y [29]. 
 
It was common ground that being “detained” was a condition precedent to the exercise of the power to grant 
bail conferred by paragraphs 22 and 29 of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act. Applying th e strict approach to 
interpretation , the Court found that t he reference to “detained” means lawful detention [30-31]. 
Furthermore, “detained” does not only refer to  the state of affairs which must exist at the time when the 
power is first exercised. Unless there is a continuing power to detain, the system of bail would encounter 
substantial difficulties in operation [32]. Where it ceases to be lawful to detain a person pending deportation 
there is no longer a power of detention under paragraph 16  of Schedule 2 , and there is therefore no longer a 
power to grant bail  under paragraphs 22 or 29 [33]. 
 
The Secretary of State submitted that as both bail and temporary admission or temporary release are 
“ameliorating possibilities” of alternatives to detention, it is sensible for both powers to persist for some 
duration beyond the point at which actual dete ntion can no longer continue. Temporary admission or release 
is covered by paragraph 21 of Schedule 2. However, unlike  paragraphs 22 and 29 , it refers to a person “liable 
to be detained” and not “detention” which is a material difference . Accordingly,  the comparison does not 
assist the Secretary of State  [34-39]. 
 
The Court did not agree with the Secretary of State’s submission that the interpretation of paragraphs 22 and 
29 favoured by the Court of Appeal would lead to impracticability in their application . In any event, if 
administrative inconvenience is a consequence the remedy lies with Parliament [40-45].  
 
The Court found considerable modern authority which supported the Court of Appeal’s statement of 
principle that  the power to grant bail presupposes the existence of and the ability to exercise the power to 
detain lawfully.  [47-51]. However, this  is not necessarily a principle of universal application. While the clearest 
possible words would be required to achieve a contrary result, Parliament could do  so [53].  
 
In the circumstances it was not necessary to address the arguments under Article 5 ECHR which added 
nothing to the resolution of the issues on appeal [56].

The Appeal is allowed. Lord Reed gives the lead judgment with which Lady Hale and Lord Hodge agree.  
Lord Mance  and Lord Hughes also allow the appeal but reach the conclusion that a duty of care existed 
by different reasoning . 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
The proposition that there is a Caparo test which applies  to all claims in the modern law of negligence, 
and that in consequence the court will only impose a duty of care where it considers it fair, just and 
reasonable to do so on th e particular facts, is mistaken [21-24]. It is normally only in novel cases, whe re 
established principles do not provide an answer , that the courts  need to exercise judgment that involves 
consideration of what is “fair, just and reasonable” [27]. This case concerned an application of 
established principles of the law of negligence and  so the existence of a duty of care did not depend on 
the application of a Caparo  test [30]. 
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Like other public authorities,  in accordance with the general law of tort , the police are subject to liability 
for causing personal injury [45-48]. On the other hand, as held by the Supreme Court in Michael v Chief 
Constable of South Wales Police (Refuge and others intervening) [2015] UKSC 2 , the general duty of the police to 
enforce the criminal law does not carry with it a private law duty towards i ndividual members of the 
public.  The common law  does not normally impose liability for omissions, or , more particularly , for a 
failure to prevent harm caused by the conduct of third parties  [50].  
 
The case of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1989] AC 53  is not authority for the proposition that 
the police enjoy a general immunity from suit in respect of anything done by them in the course of 
investigating or preventing crime.  The effect of Hill is that the police do not owe a duty of care, in  the 
absence of special circumstances, to protect the public from harm through the performance of their 
function of investigating crime [54-55]. The authorities relied on by the respondent [56-66] are not 
inconsistent with the police being  generally under a duty of care to avoid causing personal injury where 
such a duty would arise according to ordinary principles of the law of negligence  [67-68]. Applying these 
principles, the police may be under a duty of care to protect an individual from danger of injur y which 
they have themselves created [70]. 
 
The present case concerned a positive act, not an omission. The reasonably foreseeable risk of injury  to 
the Appellant when the arrest was attempted was enough to impose a duty of care on the officers [74]. 
The judge was entitled to find negligence where Willan accepted that he was aware of the risk that 
Williams would attempt to escape and of the risk to members of the public in that eve nt, that he would 
not have attemp ted the arrest at a time when he was  aware that someone was in harm’s way, and that he 
had failed to notice the Appellant [75-78]. The Appellant’s injuries were caused by the officers’  breach 
of their duty of care; she was injured as a resu lt of being exposed to the danger from which they had a  
duty of care to protect her [79-80]. 
 
Both Lord Mance and Lord Hughes agreed with the majority that the present case concerned a positive 
act, not an omission , and that the finding of the trial judge  on negligence  should be restored [82; 122 -
124]. However, Lord Mance found it unrealistic  to suggest that, when recognising and developing an 
established category of liability, the courts are not influenced by policy considerations [84]. It was not 
possible to state absolutely that policy consideration s may not shape police liability where the conduct 
of the police may be analysed as  positive, rather than simply as involving some form of omission [85-
94]. However, he concluded that we should now recognise the direct physical interface between the 
police  and the public, in the course of an arrest placing an innocent passer -by at risk, as falling within a 
now established area of general police liability for positive negligent conduct which foreseeably and 
directly inflicts physical injury [97]. 
 
Lord Hughe s referred  to vital policy considerations which impose limits on the dut y of care which the 
police owe to individuals . Such considerations are the  ultimate reason why there is no d uty of care  
imposed on police officers engaged in the investigation and prev ention of crime  towards victims, 
suspects or witnesses . The greater public good requires the absence of any duty of care  [103-120]. In 
response to these points, Lord Reed emphasised  that discussion of policy considerations is not a routine 
aspect of deciding cases in the law of negligence, and is unnecessary when existing principles provide a 
clear basis for the decision, as in the present appeal  [69].

The Supreme Court  unanimously holds that the cable should have been admitted into evid ence before 
the Administrative Court. Lord Mance and Lord Sumption (with whom Lord Neuberger, Lord Kerr, The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.su premecourt.uk  
 Lord Clarke , and Lord Reed agree) and Lady Hale write concurring judgment s on the issue of the 
admissibility  of the cable. A majority of the Court led by Lord Mance with whom Lord Neuberger, 
Lord Clarke , Lord Sumption and Lord Reed agree , dismisses the appeal on limb (i) . The exclusion of 
the cable by the Administrative Court could have had no material effect on the outcome regarding 
improper motive. Lord Kerr and Lady Hale dissent on limb (i)  of the appeal . The Court unanimously 
dismisses the appeal on limb (ii) . 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Admissibility of the Cable  
 
In his judgment Lord Mance holds  that the cable ha d lost its inviolability, for all pur poses, including its 
use in cross -examination  or evidence in the present proceedings [21 and 90]. The i nviolability of 
documents which are part of a mission archive under arts 24 and 27(2) of the VCDR makes it 
impermissible to use such documents (or copies ) in a domestic court of the host country, absent 
extraordinary circumstances such as state security, or express waiver from the mission state  [17 and 
20]. This principle is subject to two qualifications: ( a) the document must constitute and remain part of  
the mission archive , and ( b) its contents must not have b ecome so widely disseminated in the public 
domain so as to destroy any confidentiality or inviolability that could sensibly attach to it. Regarding 
(a), in the present case, o nce the cable  reached t he State Department or any other addressee , the copy 
in their hands became a document in the custody of the US Federal Government and not part of the 
London Embassy archive.  As a matter of probability, the cable  was extracted  from the State 
Department or o ne of the foreign locations to which it had been transmitted.  On that basis the cable is 
admissible [20]. Regarding (b), it is in principle possible for a document to lose inviolability where it 
comes into the public domain, even in circumstances where the  document has been wrongly extracted 
from the mission . The cable has been put into the public domain by the Wikileaks publication and the 
newspaper articles which followed, in circumstances for which the Appellant has no responsibility . On 
that ground, the  cable would also be admissible  [21]. 
 
In his judgment, Lord Sumption concludes that a document is part of  the archives of a diplomatic 
mission when it is under the control of the mission’s personnel, as opposed to other agents of the 
sending state , whethe r directly or by virtue of the terms on which the mission transmitted the 
document to another governmental entity. The document ’s origin and contents are irrelevant to that 
issue [68]. The confidentiality and inviolability  of such documents depends not on their subject -matter 
or contents but on their status as part of the archives or documents of a diplomatic mission, protected 
by art 24 of VCDR [69]. It is the obligation of the receiving state to give effect to that status, which 
includes preventing its in fringement by other parties. Thus, a court as an organ of the state would 
violate art 24 if it received and used material from the archives of a mission which came into the hands 
of a third party without authority  [70-71]. This is subject to a reservation . Documents obtained from 
the archives of a mission without authority but which have entered the public domain and are freely 
available  have already had their confidentiality  destroyed . A court would not be an instrument of the 
destruction  of its confidenti ality by using it in that circumstance [74-75]. The Respondent’s cross -
appeal on this issue faces two distinct difficulties (a) the cable did not emanate from the US mission in 
London  and (b) the document has entered the public domain [76].  
 
Lady Hale agr ees with both Lord Mance and Lord Sumption that the inviolability of the archives, 
documents and official correspondence of a mission means that they cannot generally be admitted in 
evidence under arts 24 and 27(2) of VCDR  [124] . However, Lady Hale introdu ces the qualification to 
the judgments given by Lord Mance and Lord Sumption that documents emanating from a mission 
must retain their confidentiality and consequent inviolability in some circumstances , the main purpose 
of the inviolability rule being to allow the mission to communicate in confidence with the sending 
government  [125] ; and that  ‘control’ must include  restrictions placed by the sending mission on the 
further transmission and use of the document, such as markings of confidentiality [126-127]. However, 
in this case, whatever control was initially exercised over the document, it had found its way into many 
hands and was lost even before it was put into the public domain by Wikileaks. As such, it was no 
longer inviolable and should have been admit ted in evidence: [127-128].

 Improper Motive  
 
Lord Mance (with whom Lord Neuberger, Lord Clarke, Lord Sumption and Lord Reed agree ) 
concludes that the Court of Appeal was correct to conclude that the Administrative Court’s ruling that 
the cable was inadm issible had no material effect on the outcome of proceedings and was not a ground 
for allowing the appeal  or for concluding that the motivation for creating the MPA was improper [49]. 
The appropriate test is whether the admission of the cable for use in cr oss-examination and to weigh 
against other evidence could have made a difference  (however, the precise test must depend on the 
context, including how well -placed the court is to judge the effect of any unfairness) [23-24]. This is in 
substance how the Cour t of Appeal approached the issue [24]. The Administrative Court undertook a 
full and careful review of the genesis and development of , and decision to announce , the MPA and no -
take zone  [24]. Neither  further cross -examination on the cable, nor the cable it self admitted as 
evidence, would have led to any different outcome before the Administrative Court [42]. The 
Administrative Court heard cross -examination of Mr Roberts and Ms Yeadon on important passages 
of the cable [37]. Both gave evidence that was gener ally and substantially consistent with the cable 
[39]. The cable is at the very lowest ambiguous as to whether references to resettlement were uttered 
in circumstances indicating that they had a role in motivating the proposal for an MPA. It seems very 
unlikely that a British civil servant would have disclosed an improper motivation of this nature, rather 
than outlining the practical consequences of an MPA which is what would have concerned the 
Americans [40]. Furthermore, even if Mr Roberts and/or Ms Yeado n did have and voice illegitimate 
motives for the proposal for an MPA , this was not apparent and there is no conceivable basis for 
thinking that this affected the ultimate decision to create the MPA, which was taken personally by the 
Respondent after prese ntation to him on a basis to which no objection is taken [43-49]. 
 
Lord Kerr  (with whom Lady Hale agrees ) dissents on the issue of improper motive.  They would have 
allowed the appeal  and remitted  the case  on limb (i). They consider that the Court of Appeal  should 
have recognised that there was a substantial possibility that  the Administrative Court would  have taken 
a different view of the evidence of Mr Roberts and Ms Yeadon if they had admitted the cable and the 
case had proceeded to its conventional concl usion  [121 and 128] . The correct test to be applied by the 
Court of Appeal is what might have happened if the cable was admitted in evidence not what would  have 
happened [106-112]. The exclusion of the cable restricted the cross -examination of Mr Roberts a nd Ms 
Yeadon because it was not possible to challenge their testimony where it was inconsistent, on the basis 
that the document was genuine [91]. Excluding the cable from evidence also meant that it did not rank 
as independent material and as a significant  counterweight to the FCO witnesses’ testimony [93]. 
Further , there was an equally substantial possibility that the Court of Appeal  would have concluded 
that the Respondent’s decision could be impugned because it was taken on a misapprehension of the 
true facts and circumstances  [121] .  
 
Fishing Rights   
Lord Mance (with whom all of the other Justices agree ) considers that permission to appeal should be 
given on this issue , but the appeal dismissed  [50 and 63 ]. The absence of any mention of Mauritian 
fishin g rights, whether by reference to an undertaking given by the UK Government and preferential 
treatment of Mauritian registered or owned vessels or evidence about such rights , does not undermine 
the Government’s consultation so as to justify setting it aside. The creation of a no fishing MPA would 
obviously affect inshore fishing and threaten the livelihood of vessels which had previously been 
licensed to fish in territorial waters. It was open to Mauritius to raise this objection in response to the 
consulta tion, but it did not. It would be inappropriate to treat the consultation process as invalid when 
the party to whom the rights allegedly belonged had full opportunity to assert them. There is also no 
reason to believe that the ultimate decision would or co uld have been any different if the consultation 
had specifically drawn attention to the possible existence of Mauritian fishing rights [62 and 122] . The 
UN Convention on the Law of the Sea arbitral tribunal’s finding that such fishing rights do actually 
exist and their effect in domestic law , as regards the MPA or no -take zone , was not relied on or 
capable of being relied on before the Supreme Court  or relevant to the issues arising [50-57, 63].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeal . Lord Reed and Lord Hughes give a joint judgment

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The key provisions o f the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 (“DTA”) , as in force at the relevant time , were   
s.10(1), which treats interest for the purposes of enforcement a s part of the amount to be recovered 
under the confiscation order and s.10 (2) which enables a Crown Court judg e to refix and increase the 
default term if the addition of accrued interest takes the sum outstanding into a higher bracket in the 
relevant schedule of defaults terms. [7] 
 
At the relevant time , s.9 DTA stated that where the Crown Court orders a defendant  to pay any 
amount under s .2 DTA, ss.139(1) – (4) and 140(1) – (3) of the Powers  of Criminal Courts (Sentencing 
Act) 2000  (the “ 2000 Sentencing Act”)  shall have the effect as if that amount were a fine imposed on 
the defendant by the Crown Court. [9] 
 
S.140(1) of the 2000  Sentencing Act treats for enforcement purposes a fine imposed by the Crown 
Court as if it had been imposed by the magistrates, and thus a confiscation order  is treated the same . The Supreme Cou rt of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 S.76 Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 contains the magistrates’ p ower to commit  an individual  to prison 
for failure to pay a fine and an alternative power to issue a warrant of distress (no w named a warrant of 
control). S.79 Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 is the only provision dealing with part payments. [11] 
 
The difficu lties in this case arise from the fact that the enforcement of confiscation orders is achieved 
by applying statutory provisions to confiscation orders which were not designed for them. A 
confiscation order is thus treated as if it was a fine imposed by the  magistrates. The difference between 
a magistrates  imposed fine and a Crown Court imposed fine is that magistrates do not fix a default 
term when imposing the fine. Imprisonment in default is only considered in the event of a default and, 
at that time, the  magistrates  will know whether the default is total or partial. Thus,  credit can be given 
for part payments made before the commitment process is undertaken. However, s .139(2) of the 2000 
Sentencing Act mandates the fixing of an anticipatory default term a t the time the fine or order is 
imposed. [12]  
 
The difference in practice s led the lower courts to analyse s .79(2) Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 as 
assuming the standard magistrates ’ practice and thus to conclude that the references in that subsection  
to a period of imprisonment having been “imposed… in default of payment” were references  to the 
act of the magistrates in issuing  the warrant of commitment. This caused the consequential difficulty 
that s .79(2) would say nothing about how to deal with part pay ments made in Crown Court case s 
between  the Crown Court  making a confiscation  order and the later magistrates’ proceedings. Hence 
the Court of Appeal understandably read additional words in to s.79(2). [13] 
 
The period of imprisonment in default of payment is “imposed” for the purposes of s .79 when the 
Crown Court discharges its statutory duty under s .139(2) of the 2000 Sentencing Act and fixes the 
(anticipatory) term in default.  This construction follows from s.150 Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980  and 
is necess ary to make sense of s .140(3) of the 20 00 Sentencing Act . It is also  assumed by the 
Magistrates’ Court Rules. Thus , the default term in the case of Crown Court orders must be the term 
that the court imposed at the time of making its order . [15-17] 
 
The ope rative words of s .79(2) expressly say that the days  to be deducted are to be the number which 
bear the same proportion to the total default term imposed (by the Crown Court) as the part payments 
bear “to so much of the said sum… as was due at the time the period of detention was imposed ”. At 
the time the Crown Court imposed the default term, there  was as yet no interest accrued at all. [20] 
 
Straining of the wording of s .79(2) cannot be justified where it would adversely impact on the period 
of imprisonment  to which a person is subject. Penal legislation, particularly  legislation imposing  
penalties that deprive liberty, is construed  strictly. The natural construction of the section is that the 
starting point for the arithmetical calculation of reduction in d ays of imprisonment is the sum 
outstanding at the time of the Crown Court order. [21] References  in the  section to the costs and 
charges of distress do not support the respondent’s construction. The reference is explained by the 
case of magistrates fi rst issuing a warrant for distress and only subsequently fixing the default term for 
non-payment. The addition of such costs and charges is expressly provided for and that does not mean 
that an equivalent provision can be read in as a consequence of a provision  in differen t statute (s.10(1) 
DTA) . [22]

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal . Lord Mance writes  the judgment of the court.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The background to the appeal is that no  express Parliamentary authorisation exists for the opera tion of a closed 
material procedure in any of the contexts outlined in the issues  [11]. Under ss.8 and 15 of PACE premises, not a 
person , is the subject of a warrant [12]. Any analysis should start from the initial application for a warrant, rather 
than th e end position of the application for judicial review  but any conclusions reached about earlier stages will 
be reviewed in light of the analysis of later stages [14].  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
Issue (i)  
The statutory scheme of ss. 8 and 15 of PACE permit s a Magistrates’ Court in  an ex parte application for a 
search and seizure warrant to have regard to material which cannot on public interest grounds be disclosed to a 
person affected by the warrant or order , even where this material is decisive for the legitimacy of the warrant  
[22, 37]. The statutory scheme of ss.8 and 15 of PACE is intended to be ex parte. It is a process designed to be 
operated speedily and simply on the basis of information provided by a constable satisfying a magistrate that 
there are reasonable grounds for b elieving the matters set out in s.8(1) of PACE.  There is nothing in the 
statutory scheme which expressly restricts the information on which the magistrate may act  [27]. The  statutory 
procedure under s.8 and the  Crim inal Procedure Rules also provide protect ions to persons affected by a warrant  
and the Rules themselves contemplate that the magistrate or Crown Court will see and rely on information not 
disclos able for PII reasons [25-27, 34]. Requiring the  police in these  cases  to refrain from seeking a warran t 
would limit important sources of information and the efficacy of police investigations [27]. A statutory ex parte 
procedure of this nature to secure evidence on premises is not within the general prohibition on closed 
procedures without express statutory  authorisation recognised in Al Rawi v Security Service  [2012] 1 AC 531 .  
 
Issue (iii)  
The Crown Court can on an inter partes application under s.59(7) of CJPA operate a closed material procedure 
on PII grounds  [43]. The Crown Court is required to put itse lf in the sho es of a hypothetical Magistrates’ Court 
being asked, immediately after the return of the property, to issue a fresh warrant with a view to seizure of that 
property [40]. In view of the answer to  issue (i), that Magistrates’ Court is entitled i n an ex parte application to 
have regard to information which cannot be disclosed for PII reasons  [40]. Parliament must have intended 
PACE and CJPA to operate coherently  and contemplated the Crown Court being able to operate a closed 
material procedure und er s.59 [41]. An analogy is drawn with Bank Mellat v HM Treasury (No 2)  [2014] AC 700  
where there was no express provision enabling the Supreme Court  to operate a closed material procedure  on 
appeal , but without such a power an appeal to it against a wholl y or partially closed judgment could not be 
effective  [42].  
 
Issues (ii) and (iv) are considered together as they raise essentially the same point  
The High Court can conduct a closed material procedure on judicial review of a magistrate’s order for a warr ant 
under s.8 of PACE or a magistrate’s order for disclosure or a Crown Court’s order under s.59 of CJPA [59]. 
The refer ence to judicial review in Al Rawi , was not direct ed to this situation  [59]. An alternative analysis 
where by, in the absence of a closed  material procedure, a court must presume that a public authority has acted 
properly, depriving judicial review of any real teeth , is unacceptable  [46-52]. Although judicial review and an 
appeal are not precisely equivalent, many of the considerations iden tified in Bank Mellat  as favouring a closed 
material procedure in the context of an appeal also militate in favour of a similar result in the context of judicial 
review  [54-57]. It would be unjust and potentially absurd if the High Court on judicial review  had to address a 
case on a different basis from the magistrate or Crown Court or quashed the order and remitted it to the lower 
court on a basis different from that which the lower court originally adopted. The High Court would  also be 
unable to give effe ct to the decision which the lower court or tribunal should have reached or to consider an 
outcome on the same basis as the lower court as may be required under s.31 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 
unless it can operate a closed material procedure whe n neces sary [57-58].  
 
Issue (v)  
Open  justice should prevail to the maximum extent possible  [61]. However, it cannot be axiomatic  that even the 
gist of the relevant information must be supplied to any person claiming to be affected and seeking to object to 
the wa rrant, search or seizure. Each case must be considered in the light of the particular circumstances. In 
general terms , issue (v) should be answered in the negative [65].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
As judicial officers are not employed under a co ntract of employment, th e PTWR must be construed 
in an artificial context. References to the “terms of a contract” can at best be applied by anal ogy. In 
determining  this case,  it must be borne in mind  that the judicial pension  scheme is not based upon 
individual appoin tments. Instead, regard mu st be had to the composite term “qualifying jud icial 
office”, which may include a number of  different app ointments [31].  
 
That special feature  of the scheme must be taken  into account when making  the comparison  between 
part-time and full -time judges  called for by  the PTWR , as it may be m isleading or unfair to direct 
atten tion to the nature and timi ng of individual part-time appointments  [32]. There is no reason w hy 
entitlement to pension  should be governed by the varied combinations of fee -paid or salaried offices 
undertaken by different  individual judges . This does not si t well with the a ggregate a pproach provided 
for by the 19 93 Act  [33].  
 
Regulation 5 of the PTWR mak es clear that unfavourable treatment may relate to the terms of a 
contract or “any other detriment ” resulting from an act or failure to act by the employer.  By ana logy, 
in the context of judicial pensions, a part -time jud ge may properly complain: (1) during their period of 
service  that their terms of office do not include pro per provision for a future pension; and, (2) at the 
point of retirem ent, that there has bee n a failure to make a proper pension available. The former doe s 
not exclude the latter [34]. This accords with case law, which indicates that the point of unequ al 
treatment occurs at the time the pensio n falls to be paid, and accords wit h the common sense of the 
matter  [35].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows Mr Shah’s appeal and dismisses Mr Patel’s appeal. Lady Arden 
writes the sole judgment  [33].  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) provides for a right to 
EU citizenship. This lies at the heart of the EU legal architecture  [9]. Article 20 alone does not confer 
any rights on a TCN ( see R (Agyarko v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2017] 1 WLR 623)  [10]. 
However,  the CJEU in KA v Belgium (Case C -82/16) [2018] 3 CMLR 28 (“KA”) emphasised the 
importance of the right to EU citizenship and stated that a TCN might acquire a derived right of 
residence if their removal could  deprive an EU citizen of their citizenship  rights ( KA, paras 47 – 50) 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 [15]. The TCN’s derived  right of residence is only provided  to ensure  that the EU citizen’s rights are 
effective . This limits the entitlement of a TCN to reside in the EU . There must be a “relationship of 
dependency” between the EU citizen and the TCN  [16].  
 
KA draws a distinction between the case of an EU citizen who is an adult and one who is a child ( KA, 
para 76) [13] – [14], [23]. A TCN can have a relationship of dependency with an adult EU citizen 
sufficient to justify a derive d right of residence only in  exceptional circumstances  (quoting KA, para 65 ) 
[17]. What lies at the heart of the Zambrano  jurisprudence is the requirement that the EU citizen be 
compelled to leave the EU territory if the TCN, with whom the EU citizen has a relationship of 
dependency, is removed [22]. With that context, the judgment examines Mr Patel and Mr Shah’s 
respective cases in turn.  
 
Regarding  Mr Patel, the FTT concluded that Mr Patel’s father would not accompany him to India. Unless 
Mr Patel could argue that some  case law from the CJEU, including Chavez -Vilchez  v Raad van Bestuur v an 
de Sociale verzekeringsbank  (Case C -133/15) [2018] QB 103 (“ Chavez -Vilchez ”), relaxes the level of 
compulsion required in the case of adults, and thus provides assistance to Mr Patel , his appeal must fail . 
However, any possible qualification Chavez -Vilchez  makes to the general princi ple of compulsion does 
not apply in the case of adults. Chavez -Vilchez  is about children.  KA makes clear that children and adults 
are treated separately and a TCN  will only have a derivative right of residence by reference to a dependant 
relationship with an adult EU citizen in exceptional circumstances. Chavez -Vilchez  does not relax the level 
of compulsion required in the case of adults. It is of no assistance to Mr Patel. His appeal must fail  as 
his parents would not be compelled to leave the UK  [27].  
 
Chavez -Vilchez  does not impact Mr Shah’s appeal. That appeal depends on the FTT’s findings of fact and 
whether the CA correctly identified the relevant findings for the purposes of the compulsion test . The 
FTT found that Mr Shah was the primary carer of hi s son ; as such, the child had the relevant relationship 
of dependency with Mr Shah. Further, Mrs Shah’s evidence was that if Mr Shah were removed from the 
UK then the family would move  out of the EU . This was accepted by the FTT, who held that it was an 
inescapable conclusion that the son would have to leave with his parents . Therefore , the FTT found  the 
requirement of compulsion was met [28].  
 
The CA used the fact that Mrs Shah ’s decision to leave the EU was voluntary and she could look after 
the child  without Mr Shah  to justify  holding that there was no question of compulsion [29]. The Supreme 
Court disagreed. The overarching question is whether the son would be compelled to leave  with his 
father, who was his primary carer,  because of his dependen cy on his father. In answering that question , 
the Supreme Court had to take into account the child’s bests interests and his relationship with each 
parent,  as explained in Chavez -Vilchez , para 71. The compulsion test is practical. It is to be applied to th e 
actual facts. The FTT found the son would be compelled to leave. That is sufficient compulsion for the 
purposes of Zambrano  [30]. Therefore, Mr Shah’s appeal was allowed [32] – [33].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The inspector ’s finding in the Lancaster  case that the land was not acquired and held pursuant to 
statutory education purposes was inconsistent with the evidence and irrational  [33]-[34]. Therefore t he 
central issue in both the case s under appeal  is the interpretation and application of the  statutory 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 incompatibility  ground of decision identified in the majority judgment in the Supreme Court in R 
(Newhaven  Port & Properties Ltd) v East Sussex County Council [2015] UKSC 7 (“ Newhaven ”) [43].  
 
The majority’s opinion  is that Newhaven  authoritatively i nterpreted the Act to mean  that where land is 
acquired and held for defined statutory purposes by a public authority, the Act does not enable the public 
to acquire rights over that land by regist ering it  as a green  where such registration would be incompatible 
with those statutory purposes [48]. Here  there is an incompatibility between the statutory purposes for 
which the land is held and use of that land as a green  and therefore the Act is not applicable [55]. 
 
The test set out in Newhaven  is not whether the land has been allocated by statute for particular  purposes, 
but rather whether it has been acquired by the public authority pursuant to its statutory powers and is 
held for the purposes  of those powers, where those purposes are incompat ible with registration of the 
land as a green  [56]. The reference to acquisition by both voluntary sale and compulsory purchase is 
significant, since acquisition by voluntary sale will typically involve the exercise of general statutory 
powers rather than specific statutory provisions framed by reference to the land itself [57]. This 
construction of the Act is unsurprising ; there is no indication that the general provisions in the Act 
regarding registration as a green were intended to have the effect of prevent ing use of land held by a 
public authority for specific public purposes defined in statute [61]. This general point can be  made with 
particular force in relation to  land held pursuant to the exercise of  statutory compulsory purcha se 
powers, since such powers are created for use in circumstances where there is an especially strong public 
interest that land should be used for particular purposes, such as is capable of justifying  compelling a 
land-owner to sell their land against the ir wishes  [63]. 
 
Applying the Act as interpreted in Newhaven , LCC and the NHS can show that there is statutory 
incompatibility in each case. In the Lancaster case , the rights claimed pursuant to the registration of the 
land as a green are incompatible with the use of the relevant  areas for education purposes, including for 
example use of them as playing fields or for constructing new school buildings. LCC does not n eed to 
show they are currently being used for such purposes, only that they are held for such statutory purposes  
[65]. Similar points apply in the Surrey case : the issue of incompatibility has to be decided by reference 
to the statuto ry purposes for which the land is held, not by reference to how the land happens to be 
used at a particular point in time  [66]. 
 
Lady Arden disagrees with the reasoning of the majority. She would have allowed the appeal s save that 
she would have dismissed the appeal in relation  to two of the areas of the Lancashire site and remitted 
the matter to the registration authority in the Surrey appeal  [122] . In her view, the fact that a public 
authority holds land for statutory purposes that are incompatible with the use of the land as a green is 
not of itself sufficient to make the land incapable of being registered. It must be shown that the land is 
in fact being , or that it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be,  used pursuant to those powers in a manner 
inconsistent with the public’s rights on registration as a green [77]. 
 
Lord Wilson dissents from the majority and would have dismissed both appeals  [123] . The Act ’s reach  
is substantially reduced if land held by public authorities for  specified statutory purposes is to be immune 
from registration as a green that could theoretically be incompatible with those  purposes [126] . Newhaven  
was concerned with statutes that conferred specific duties in relation to particul ar land . Those specific 
duties were incompatible with the general provision in the Act which therefore had to give way  [131] . 
In contrast,  the present cases involve statutory provisions that confer general power s to acquire and hold 
unspecified land for education and health purposes  and these cannot be said to be incompatible with 
the provision in the Act  [132].

The Supreme Court unanimou sly allows  the appeal  only to the extent of remitting the  case t o the First 
Division of the Inner  House to consider what is the appropr iate remedy under section 2 42(4) of the 
1986 Act . Lord Hodge gives the sole judgment with which the other Jus tices agree.  The Supreme Court of the Unite d Kingdom  
 Parliament Squa re London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Sup reme Court  holds  that the meaning of “adequate consideration ” is to be determined according  
to an objective test , having rega rd to the c ommercial justification of the transaction in all the 
circumstances and assuming that the parties  would be acting in good faith and a t arm’s length  [30-32]. 
 
As to the circumstances  that would be relevant to this asses sment , the Court  consider s that, unles s the 
insolvent party ’s financial embarrassment  is known in the relevant market, the hypothetical purchaser 
will not be assumed to have knowledge of it [32]. Accordingly, it is not relevant that Mr Quinn  advised 
Mr Gaf fney of Grampian ’s financia l difficult ies. However, the fact of Grampian ’s insolvency is, itself, a 
relevant circumstance , in that an insolvent vendor would  be expected to manage its as sets in such a  
way as to protect t he interests of  its creditors  [33]. The objective p urpose of the  sale is also a relevant 
circumstance . Whilst  an off-market sale  poses the  obvious risk of  obtaining an inad equate price , the 
Court recognise s that a quick sa le may sometimes  be in the interes t of the creditors , such as when the 
insolvent party faces liqui dity issues  and the sale would enable it to trade out of insolvency  [34].  
 
Where there is no prospect that the sale would enable the in solvent company to remain in business, 
the adequacy of the consideration  will depend on  wheth er there is prejudice to  the insolvent  
company ’s creditors  [37]. This involves comparing the outcomes which woul d have been  available in 
the circ umstances of the in solvency.  In cases  where  a full marketing exercise  woul d no t have been 
possible , or where the asset was be ing sold as p art of an i nformal winding up , the consideration 
achieved in the sale should  not be measured against the open ma rket price but against the price , net of 
expenses,  that would have  been obtained  by a liquid ator o f the company , or else by the holder of any 
security  over the asset , assuming their compli ance with applicable legal duties [37-39].  
 
In the present case, the sale of the Property was part of an informal winding up of Grampian . As such, 
the Court consider s that there could be no justi fication for an off-market sale at a price so far b elow 
market value on the ground of urgency  [40]. Carnbroe ha s not established that there was ade quate 
consideration as it ha s not le d any ev idence to support  the view that a sale by NatWest (as the ho lder 
of a standard se curity over  the Property) , or else by the liquidator s, would have been likely to achieve a 
comp arable or lower net price than that  which G rampian  accepted  [42]. As such, the Inner House was 
entitled to inter fere with the Lord Ord inary ’s assessment of the adequacy of the consideration.  
 
As to  the appropri ate remedy , the liqu idators argue  that section 242(4) of the 1986 Act  require s the 
courts to annul  any transaction  with an insolvent compan y for less than adequate  consideration , save 
where such annulment  is impossible . However , the Supreme Court consider s that such  a rule could 
produce harsh and disproportionate  effects , since section 242(b) would cap ture sales to  good faith, 
arm’s length purcha sers for substantial (if not ade quate ) considerat ion [45]. If such a transaction  were 
reversed , the good faith purchaser would be forced to compete as an unsecured creditor to recover th e 
consideration  it had paid , with the insolvent  vendor ’s general  credi tors receiving a windfall [51].  
 
In a departure  from previous  decision s of the Inner  House , the Supreme Court con clude s that the 
statutory words of section  242(4) are broad enough to allow the courts, in appropri ate cases , to devise 
a remedy to protect th e good faith  purchase r [53, 63, 65]. In the absence of a greed fa cts as to the 
impact of reversing the present trans action, the Court remit s the case to the Inner House  to determine 
whether it is appropriate to qualify the re medy it has given to take accoun t of all or part o f the 
consideration  paid by Carnb roe for the p urchase  [69].

REASONS  FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
There were two  particular questio ns before the Supre me Court  [2].  First, was the detention of each 
respondent lawful , given that article 28 of the Regulation permits detention where there is a “ significant 
risk of absconding ”?  The phrase  “risk of absconding ” is define d in artic le 2(n)  of the Regulation  as the 
existence of reasons in an individual case, based on objective criteria defined by law, to believe that the 
person might abscond .  Secon dly, if the detention was not lawful, are damages  payable either under 
domest ic law for false  (or wrong ful) impri sonment , or pursuant to what is known as the Factortame  
principle established in Brasserie du Pecheur SA v Germany; R v Transport Secretary; Ex p Factortame Ltd No 4  
(Joined Ca ses C -46/93 and C-48/93) [1996] QB 404 ?

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 A policy such as that embodied in Chapter 55 of the EIG is published so that an individual affected by 
it knows the criteria by which the executive has chosen to exercise the power conferred upon it by 
statute .  Its publication als o allo ws the individual to make appropriate representations in relation to 
that exercise of power as it affects him or her  [49].  The executive must follow its stated po licy unless 
there are good grounds for not doing so  [50].  Chapter 55  does not establis h objective criteria for the  
assessment of whether an applicant for international protection who is subject to a Dublin III transfer 
procedure may abscond .  Its contents do not constitute a framework with certain predetermined limits .  
Further,  it does not  set out the limits of the f lexibility of the relevant authorities in assessing the 
circumstances of each case in a manner which is binding and known in advance.  Therefore, the Court 
of Appeal was right to hold that Chapter 55 cannot satisfy the requireme nts of articles 28 (2) and 2( n) 
of the Regulation  [65]. 
 
Chapter 55 does not sat isfy the requirements la id down by the Court of Justice of the European Union  
in Policie ČR, Krajské ředitelství policie Ústeckého kraje, odbor cizinecké policie v Al Chodor  (Case C -528/15) 
[2017] 4 WLR 125 .  Becau se Chapter 55  does not set out the limits of the flexibility of the relevant 
authorities in assessing the circumstances of each case in a manner which is binding and known in 
advance , it lacks the necessary qualities of certainty and predictability.   It therefore does not constitute 
a “law” for the purposes of articles 28(2) and 2(n)  [74].  A broader question is whether a stat ement of 
policy and public law adherence to it can ever amount to a binding provision of general application 
and so a “ law” within the meaning of article 2(n)  [75].  That question sho uld be decided in a case in 
which it is necessary to do so [79]. 
 
Any cla im by the respondents for d amages under European Union law must be judged by reference to 
the principles establis hed in Francovich v Italy  (Case C -6/90) [1993] 2 CMLR 66  and Factortame .  
However, those principles do not constrain the claim by the responden ts for damages for wrongful 
imprisonment  [88].  In R (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2011] UKSC 12; [2012] 1 
AC 245 , the Supreme Court consider ed the  test for when a public law error  bearing upon and relevant 
to a decision to detain can found a claim for damages for false impri sonment .  That test  is met in the 
cases in this appeal .  There was a requirement for a binding provision of general application containing 
objective criteria underlying the reasons for believing that an applicant  might abscond, and that 
requirement was not satisfied.   This was funda mental to the decision to detain and it makes no 
difference whether the source of that requirement lay in European Union or domestic legislation  [98]. 
 
Chapter 55 did not comply with ar ticles 28(2) and 2( n) of the Regulation , with the consequence that, in 
the case of each of the respondents, the decision to detain lay outside the scope of any legitimate 
exercise of the discretion conferred by Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act.  The ingredients of the tort of 
wrongful imprisonment were undoubtedly present.   The right under domestic law to  claim damages 
for wrongful imprisonment is not dependent on the law being clear .  Nor is it dependent up on 
whether the illegality is the consequence of a failur e to comply with European Union legislation  (as in 
this case ) or has some other cause  [101] . 
 
The majority in the Court of Appeal were right to h old that the respondents were wrongfully detained .  
The respondents are entitled to compensation under domestic  law for any loss  that the wrongful 
detention has caused them  [105, 114].  The Secretary of State ’s submission that the respondents should 
only be entitled to nominal damages is rejected [106-112].  It is not necessary in thi s appeal to consider 
the respon dents’ alternative claim for damages under European Union  law, since i t is not contended 
that any  such damages would exceed those payable for false imprisonment  under dom estic law [113] .  
The County Court will assess the amount of damages, if it cannot be agreed  [114].

The question is whether the tribunal correctly identified ‘the reason (or , if more than one, the principal 
reason) f or the dismissal ’ under  section 103A , which relates specifically to whistleblowing . But t hese 
words also appear elsewhere  in Part X, including in section 9 8, the general provision  for unfair 
dismissal . So the  court ’s answer  must relate equally to those other sections  [39]. While the question  
seems to be of wide importance,  however,  the facts of th is case are extreme: instances of decisions to 
dismiss taken in good faith, not just for a w rong reason but for a reason which the employee’s line 
manager has dishonestly constructed, will not be common  [40-41]. 
 
When  applying a rule to a company which requi res attributing to it a state of mind , it is neces sary to  
consider  the language  of the rule (if it is a statute) , as well as its content and policy [42-43]. By section 
103A, Parliament clearly intended to provide that, where th e real reason for dismissal w as 
whist leblowin g, the automatic consequence should be a finding of unfair dismissal  [44-45]. The Court 
of Appeal in this case determined that, when  an employee ’s line manager  hides the rea l reason behind a 
fictitious reason , the latter is to be taken as t he reason for di smiss al if adopted in good faith by the 
decision -make r [46]. It considered itself b ound by i ts earlier decision in Orr v Milton Keynes Council  
[2011] EWC A Civ 62, [2011] ICR 704  (“Orr”), which held that it was the knowledge only of the 
decision-maker  which fell to be attributed to the employer  for the purposes of section 98  [47-49]. Yet, 
for various reasons , Orr was not a satisfactory vehicle for the articulati on of principle ; nor were its facts 
comparable to those in the present c ase [50-53]. 
 
The compan y, in opposing the attribution to it of the kno wledge  of Ms Jhuti ’s line  manager , argues 
that section  47B of the Act already gives protection  to whist leblowers , such that  there is no reason  to 
construe  section 103A as captur ing reason s for dismissal  other than the decision -maker ’s [54]. Section 
47B protects workers from being subjected to detriment by acts  of the employe r (subsection (1)) , or of 
another worker  (subsections (1 A) to (1E) ). In the latter case  the employer is liable for the other 
worker ’s acts [55]. But t he tribunal attributed to the  company the acts of Ms Jhuti’s line manager  
which  it found to have cause d detriment  to her, and held that subsection (1), rather than subsections 
(1A) to (1E) , applied . This attribution  to the compan y (which it does  not challenge)  of acts which it 
could not have authorised had it known of the circumstances surrounding them  provides  no support 
for its appr oach to attribution under section 103A [56]. 
 
The wider d imension of the  company ’s argument based on section 47B  is that the right  it gives  to 
workers  in Ms Jhuti ’s position  affords t o them all the relief they could reasonably expect  [57]. Yet 
Parliament ha s, by section 103A, provided that a dismis sal should automatically be unfair  where an 
employee ’s whistleblowing  is the reason for i t. It has also, by section 47B(2), withdrawn the protection 
of that s ection  from whist leblowers subjected to a detriment  which ‘amounts to ’ dismissal  [58]. It is 
therefore obvious that whist leblowers are not confined to r emed ies under se ction 47B  [59]. 
 
In searching for the reason for a dismissal , courts need generally look only at  the reason  given by the 
decision -maker. But where the real reason is hidden from the deci sion-maker be hind an invented 
reason, the court  must  penetrate through  the invention  [60-61]. So the answer to the  appeal ’s key 
question  is, ‘yes, if a person  in the hierarchy  of responsibility  above the employee determines that  she 
should be dismissed for one reason but hides it behind an  invented reason whi ch the decision -make r 
adopts, the reason for the dismissal is the hidden reason rathe r than the invented reason ’ [62].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal  and remits the matter for assessment of the value 
of the loss of the opportunity to pursue the services claim . Lord Lloyd -Jones  gives  the judgment, with 
which  all members of the Court agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
In order to succeed in his claim in t he tort of negligence, Mr Watkins had to establish a negligent breach 
of duty, causation and loss. The trial judge found that there had been a negligent breach of duty and that 
causation was established . Neither conclusion has been appealed [22]. To succee d, therefore , Mr 
Watkins’s estate must prove loss, specifically that in losing the opportunity to pursue the claim Mr 
Watkins lost something of value , i.e. that his  services  claim had a real and substantial rather than merely 
a negligible prospect of success [23]. 
 
Mr Watkins’s original claim was within the Scheme, and it is therefore necessary to consider whether the 
claim was of more than negligible value within the context  of that Scheme [25]. The expert report was 
concerned with causation , not loss,  and was prepared  to assist in the assessment of whether Mr Watkins’s 
failure to pursue a service s claim arose from negligent advice or from an inability to assert truthfully th at 
he had lost the ability to perform activities that would qualify him for a services award [27]. As a result, 
the expert was instructed not to apply the presumption used under the Scheme [28]. 
 
Had Mr Watkins pursued a services claim it would have procee ded on the basis of the Scheme’s 
procedures. He would have had to undergo  only a limited second medical examination and there would 
have been no equivalent of the expert ’s report. His entitlement to a services award would have been 
decided by the applicati on of the Scheme ’s presumption . There was no justification for considering  a 
further medical examination and report which would not have been commissioned under the Scheme 
and therefore the judge erred in taking this into account  [29]. Given other findings in the  expert report , 
the court is unable to accept that the services claim had no chance of success so that the lost claim was 
of no value [30]. The first -instance judge should have proceeded to assess the value of the lost claim on 
a loss of opp ortunity basis . The court therefore dismisses the appeal and remits the matter for that 
assessment [32].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Sales  gives  the judgment, with which  all

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Planning permission is required for development of land, which includes  the making of any material 
change in use (sections 57(1) and 55(1) of the 1990 Act). The planning authority must have regard to the 
development plan and any other considerations materi al to the proposed change of use  (section 70(2) of 
the 1990 Act and section 38(6) of the 2004 Act) [31]. 
 
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
 
A three -fold test  for “material considerations ” is found  in Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the 
Environment [1981] AC 578 (“ Newbury ”). This require s that the conditions imposed: (1)  be for a planning 
purpose  and not for any ulterior purpose; (2) fairly and reasonably relate to the development; and  (3) 
must not be so unreasonable that no reasonable planning authority could have imposed them [32-33]. 
It is logical to equate the ambit of “material considerations ” with the scope of the power to impose 
planning conditions , because if the planning author ity has the power to impose a condition it follows 
that it could treat the imposition of that condition as a material factor in favour of granting permission. 
The relevance of the Newbury  criteria to determine the ambit of “material considerations ” in the 1990 
and 2004 Acts is well established and is not in contention on this appeal [34]. 
 
It is a fundamental principle of the planning system that planning permission cannot be bought or sold. 
A principled approach to identifying material considerations in line with the Newbury  criteria is important 
to protect landowners and the public interest, since it prevents a planning authority from extracting 
money or other benefits  unrelated to the propo sed use of the land  as a condition for granting permission  
and from deciding whether to grant permission by reference to such matters rather than by reference to 
the planning merits of the proposed development in issue  [39]. This protection has been establ ished by 
Parliament through statute, as interpreted by the courts, and cannot be overridden by general policies 
laid down by central government  [42].  
 
In the present case, the community benefits promised by Resilient did not satisfy the Newbury  criteria 
and therefore did not qualify as a material consideration under  either the 1990 or the 2004 Act.  The 
benefits were not proposed to pursue a proper planning purpose , but rather for the ulterior purpose of 
providing general benefits to the communit y. They did not fairly and reasonably relate to the 
development for which permission was sought ; the community benefits did not affect the use of the 
land but were instead proffered as a general inducement to the Council to grant planning permission , in 
breach of the principle that planning permission  cannot be bought or sold [44]. 
 
The statutory concept of a “material consideration” as interpreted by the courts does not vary according 
to government guidance and policy statements [45-49]. On the other hand,  a change  in national policy 
can affect the issue of whether a decision satisfies the third limb of the Newbury  test, by making it clear 
that a reasonable local planning authority can properly consider  that a particular condition  is justified in 
terms of planning policy [53].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeal  against the  local authority ’s decision . It orders that 
RR’s housing be nefit is to be recalculate d without making the under -occupancy de duction of 14% , in 
order to avoid a breach of RR ’s rights under the Convention , contr ary to s 6(1) HRA . Lady Hale gives 
the only reasoned judgment .    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
It is not un constitutional for a public authority, court or tribunal to dis apply a provision of subordinate 
legislation which would otherwise result  in their acting incompatibly with a  Convention right, where 
this is necessary in order to comply with the HRA . Subordi nate legislation is subordinate t o the HRA , 
which is an Act of P arliament  [27]. The H RA draws a clear and careful distinction between primary 
and subordinate legis lation, both in s 6 (the requirement for public authorities to act compatibly with 
Convention  rights) and in s 3 (the interpretative obligation)  [28]. Primary legislation which cannot be 
read or given effect compatibly with Convention  rights must still be given effect  under the exception 
in s 6(2) , but this exception does not extend to subordinate legislation , where there is no primary 
legislation preventi ng removal of the incompatibility  [29].  
 
The courts have consistently held that , where  it is possible to do so, a provision of subordi nate 
legislation which re sults in a breach of a Convention  right must be disregar ded, if it is possible to do so  
without affecting the s tatutory scheme  [18-23, 30]. A decision -maker must find that a claimant who is 
unjustifiably discriminated against  is entitled to the  housing ben efit he would have received if the 
discrimination  had not occur red [30]. Otherwise the local  authority or court would be acting  in a 
manner which s 6 HRA dec lares to be unlawful [32].  
 
On the qu estion of whether  any DHPs received by the appellant  should be deduc ted from the housing 
benefit t o which he is entitl ed as a result o f this decision,  the parties were agreed as to the position. 
The appeal concerns the initial decision made by th e local authorit y to make a d eduction under 
regulation B13 to the appellant ’s housing benefit. At that stage  no question of DHPs could have aris en 
and the only question was entitlement to housing benefit. It is for the loca l authority to consi der 
whether  there are any steps which they can or wish to take to recover any DHPs [33-34]. 
 
It follow s that the Supreme Court should  make the same order as the U T made in Carmichael UT  for 
the same reason as the UT gave in that case  [35].

 (“UNCAT ”) [16]. Accordingly,  the wording of section 134 CJA must bear the same meaning as in article 1 
UNCAT. The principle s governing the interpretation of treaties are to be found in articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna 
Convention on the Law of Treaties 19 69 (“VCLT”) [23]. The ordinary meaning of the words describe s a person 
performing official administrative or governmental functions and provide s no suggestion that those functions 
must be performed on behalf of the government of a State [25] . The object of UNCAT was not to outlaw torture 
but rather to strengthen the  prohibition that already exists in international law  [27]. The drafting history indicate s 
that torture committed by public officials fo r purposes connected with their public functions was  considered 
different in  nature from, and inherently more serious than, that  inflicted by a pr ivate person.  The conduct of 
rebels  exercising governmental functions over the civ ilian population of territory under its control is  properly the 
concern of the international community and falls within this rationale  [36] .  
 
The appellant’s suggested reading gives rise to a number of  anomalies concerning issues of recognition of States 
and governments. The offence applies without distinction between recognised and unrecognised States. Similarly, resort to State practice in the recognition or non- recognition of governments cannot provi de a uniform standard 
by which the Convention can be applied  [56-59]. 
 
The majority  concludes  that “a person acting in an official capacity” in section 134(1) CJA includes a person who 
acts or purports to act, otherwise than in a private and individual capacity, for or on behalf of an organisation or 
body which exercises, in the territory controlled by that organisation or body and in which the relevant conduct 
occurs, functions normally exercised by governments over their civilian populations. Furthermore, it covers any 
such person whether acting in peace time or in a situation of armed conflict [76]. The exercise of a governmental 
function , which is a core require ment,  must be distinguished from purely military activity not involving any 
governmental function [77-78]. It is necessary to look at the reality of any particular situation . The  question is 
whether the entity has established a sufficient degree of control, authority and organisation to become an authority exercising official or quasi- official powers, as opposed to a rebel faction or mere military force  [79] .  
 
In the light of furt her evidence from the prosecution’s expert witness  regarding the nature of the NPFL’s control 
over the relevant territory , it is necessary for this matter to be remitted to the judge to reconsider whether there 
is sufficient evidence to enable a properly d irected jury to conclude that the appellant was acting in an official 
capacity [80] . 
 Lord Reed d issents from the majority’s reasoning and  finds the appellant’s arguments more persuasive [82] . The 
ordinary meaning of the phrase does not extend to a member of an insurgent group engaged in armed insurrection 
against the government of the country.  The core idea is that the person is acting on behalf of the S tate [83] . The 
reference to “lawful sanctions” later in article 1 supports the view that it is co ncerned with conduct for which the 
State bears responsibility  [84]. If torture carried out by insurgents in territory under their de facto control falls 
within the scope of article 1, then article 2(1)  UNCAT, which requires each State Party to take measures to prevent 
acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdictio n, imposes an obligation with which States  cannot comply , since 
they cannot take effective measures in relation to territory they do not control [85]. The problem which UNCAT 
was intended to address was the reluctance of states to investigate and prosecute  torture in which their authorities 
were themselves involved  [87-88]. A number of States Parties  have adopted a definition in their domestic law 
based on the understanding that article 1 is confined to situations where  the responsibility of state authorities is 
engaged [90]. In relatively recent times, there appears to have been a development in the CAT’s interpretation of 
article 1 . Accordingly, even if article 1 might now be interpreted as extending to the actions of non -state entities, 
it does not follow that it should be interpreted in the same way when considering the criminality of actions that took place in 1990 [9 5-98]. Finally, criminal legislation whose meaning is unclear should be given a restrictive 
rather than an expansive interpretation [98] .

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  Daiwa’s appeal  and holds that the  High Court order 
should stand . Lady Hale gives  the only substantive judgment.    
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 188 6/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Daiwa  argued that , as Singularis was effectively  a one man comp any, and Mr A l Sanea its controlling 
mind and will, his fr aud should be attributed to the company, wi th the result that  its Quincec are claim  
again st Daiwa should fail for illegality, lack of causation or because of a countervailing claim for  deceit 
[1]. Lady Hal e agrees with t he judge that whether or not Mr Al Sanea’s fraud was att ributed to the 
company, th ose defences would fail in a ny event  [12]: 
 
(i) Illegality  
The illeg ality relied  on by D aiwa was Mr Al Sanea’s provisio n of false documents in relation  to the 
payments and his breach of fiduci ary duty towards Singula ris. As the  judge found, f iduciary duties are 
intended to pr otect a comp any from becoming th e victim of the wrongful exe rcise of power by the 
company’s officers. That p urpose would no t be enhanced by preventing the company ’s recovery of the 
money wrong fully removed from its account. The Quincecare  duty str ikes a careful balanc e between the 
interests of the customer and thos e of the bank and denying the claim would not enhance the inte grity 
of the law [16]. 
 
Denial of the claim would  undermine the public interest in requiring banks to play an important part in 
uncovering financi al crime and money laundering [17]. It woul d also be an unfair and disp roportionate 
respon se to any w rongdoing on the part of Singularis : the power to make a deduction for contributory 
negligen ce enable s the court to make a more appropriate adj ustment [18]. The judge ’s conclusion on 
this issue was correct , whether or not the fraud was attributed to the com pany [21]. 
 
(ii) Causation  
Daiwa argued that if the fraud  was attributed to the company, its loss was caused by its own fault and 
not that of the b ank. However , the purpose of the Quincecare  duty is to protect the bank ’s customers 
from har m caused by pe ople for whom the customer is responsible. The f raudulent instru ction to 
Daiwa gave rise to the duty of care which Daiwa  breached, thus c ausing the lo ss [23]. 
 
(iii) Counterv ailing claim in dec eit 
This was  a variant of the c ausation argu ment. The judge held that Daiwa ’s breach of duty and not Mr 
Al Sanea’s misrepresentations was the cause of Daiwa’s expos ure to the claim for Singularis ’ loss [24]. 
 
Attributio n 
Mr A l Sanea’s fraud should not however be attributed to the company for the purposes of the 
Quinceca re claim.  The basic p rinciple was that a  properl y incorporated company has an identity and legal 
perso nality s eparate from that o f its shareholders and di rector s. The company has to act through the 
medium of real human beings but the acts of those pers ons are only treated as the acts and intentions 
of the com pany i n circums tances specified by its constitution , or the ordinary rules of agency and 
vicarious l iability, or other particular rules of law [28].  
 
As the judge noted, t he answer to any question whether to attribute the knowledge of a f raudulent 
director to the company is always to be found in consideration  of the context and purpose for which 
the att ribution is relevant  [34]. The context  in this case is the breach of Daiwa’s Quincecare  duty of care. 
To attribute the fraud of a trusted agent of the company to the company would denude the duty of any 
value in cases where it is most needed  and be a retrograde step [35].

The appeal raises  two questio ns.  First, was the inherent jurisdiction  available  to the Court of Appeal  in 
principle ?  Second , if so, was th e exercise o f it flawed ?  The answer  to both questi ons is “yes” [2-3]. 
 
Inherent Jurisdiction Available  
The mother  argued  that the inhere nt jurisdiction  had not been available to the Court of Appeal  on the 
grounds that  a summary  order (i.e. an or der made without a full, conventional , investigation ) for the  
child’s return  outside th e Convention could only have been made as a ‘specific issue order ’ under the 
Children Act 1 989 ( ‘the 1989 Act ’) [26].  A specifi c issue order is an order  made  to decide a question 
connected with any aspect of parental responsibili ty for a child : had it bee n appropriate on the fact s to 
make such an order here, it would have been open to  the Court of Appeal to  do so  [27-28]. 
 
Before the introduction  by the 1989 Act  of specific issue orders , summary orders for the return of a 
child ab road could be made  under t he inherent juris diction [29-30].  Such  order s continued to exist 
alongside order s under the Convention  after it was introduced  into domestic law by the  1985 Act , 
since  differences between the inherent jurisdiction and the Convent ion mean that  an ord er for  a child ’s 
return may , in some circumstances,  be required under the former , but not the latter , legal framework  
[31].  But did the 1989 Act  do away with  the inherent juris diction to order a child ’s return  [32]? 
 
The mother argued that para 1.1 of Practice Direction  12D, supplement ing the Family Procedure 
Rules 2010, showed that the 1989  Act did have that effect : for it  instructs  that the inherent jurisdiction 
should  only be invo ked where the issues ‘cannot be resolved under the 198 9 Act’ [33-36].  However, 
practice direction s have no legal authority to the extent that they state the law incorrectly  [37-38].  
There is no statut ory basis  for th e instruction  in para 1. 1, and the case-law indicates that an order can 
be made  under the in herent jurisdictio n even w here a specific issue order would also have been  
available  [39-43].  Therefore the instruction in para 1.1  goes too far .  However , if an order is available  
by both routes  and a party choose s to invoke  the inherent jurisdiction , the judge will need to b e 
persuaded  early in the proceedings  that that choice  was reasona ble [44].  Nor does the court accept the 
mother ’s argument  that a n application for a summary  specific issue order requires a different inquiry 
from an analogous applicat ion under the inheren t jurisdiction.   The same approach  is required under 
both frameworks, as both are based on  the principle tha t the child ’s welfare  is paramount  [45-50]. 
 
Exercise of Inherent Jurisdiction Flawed  
The Court of Appeal did not inquire  into whether the child ’s wel fare required  a summary orde r for her 
return , as it consider ed that t he High Court  had made that determination  and had not erred in doing so  
[51].  Yet the judge had  not made a  determination  under the inherent jurisdiction  [52].  Nor could his 
determinatio n under  the Conventio n stand as one under the inher ent jurisdiction : for the Convention , 
unlike the inherent jurisdiction , is not based  on the paramo untcy of the child ’s welfare  [53]. 
 
The fact that the father had not invoked the inh erent jurisdiction did not prevent  the Court of Appeal 
from making an order under it.  But it did place a duty on  the Court of Appeal  to ask whether the 
mother  had had sufficient notice of its intention to use the inherent jurisdiction  to allow her to seek to 
oppose it  [54].  The Court of Appeal should also have considered  eight further  questions  before 
making its order under the inherent jurisdiction , including whether the e vidence before it was 
sufficiently up to date, and  whether the High Court judge had  made findings sufficient to ju stify the 
order  [55-63].  Its failure to consider any of the se questi ons is wha t led the Supreme Court  to uphold 
the appeal  [64].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The court  has a general  power to order non -parties to pay costs under section 51 of the Senior Courts 
Act 1981  [25]-[26]. In the context of liability insurance, it is important for the courts to apply clear 
and reas onably detailed principles so that liability insurers can understand their position. It is not 
enough for the c ourts to ask whether the case is “exceptional”  because this would not provide adequate 
certainty [33]; [51]. 
 
Broadly speaking, the authorities r eveal two approaches to deciding whether a third party should pay 
costs: (1) whether the third party took control of the litigation and became “the real defendant” ; and (2) 
whether the third party engaged in “unjustified intermeddling” . 
 
The “real defendan t” test, as explained by the Court of Appeal in TGA Chapman Ltd v Christopher  [1998] 1 
WLR 12 , provides useful guidelines for cases where insurance exists  but some part of the claim 
(including the claim for costs) lie s outside the limits of cover [48]-[53]. However, it is inappropriate in 
cases like this where the claims are wholly uninsured  [54]. In such cases , the appropriate question is 
whether the insurer engaged in “unjustified intermeddling”  in litigation to which it was not a party . If the 
insurer ha s acted within a framework of contractual obligation, it may be very hard to establish that it 
has “intermeddled”  [55]-[56]; [78]. It will usually be necessary to establish a causative link betwee n the 
insurer’s involvement and the claimants’ incurring of costs [65]-[67]; [80]. 
 
In this case, all the claims  were pursued within a single group action by common solicitors. They 
involved common issues which were being tried together in four test claims (which , as it turned out,  
comprised two insured  and two uni nsured claims) [68]; [79]. Travelers had a legitimate  interest in 
Transform’s defence of the insured claim s and, consequently, in Transform’s defence of the test cases 
and common issues. Travelers’  involvement was the natural result of its status as an ins urer and did 
not amount to unjustified intermeddling [69]. 
 
The courts below relied on a number of specific instances of Travelers’ conduct. However, none of 
them crossed the line into unjustified intermeddling:  
 
(1) Non -disclosure of the limits of cover.  Travelers’ and Transform’s solicitors advised 
Transfo rm not to disclose the limits of its insurance cover . However, as the law stands, parties 
are not legally obliged to disclose the details of their insurance [59]. The advice about non -
disclosure fairly refle cted Travelers’ right s relating to the insured claims [63]-[64]; [81]. 
 
(2) Offers and admissions.  Travelers was involved in Transform’s decisions not to make offers 
of settlement or admissions to the uninsured claimants [70]-[71]. If necessary, t he court woul d 
conclude this involvement was justified but in any event, it did not cause the claimants to incur 
costs . By 2015 the uninsured claimants were determined to pursue their claims  to a judgment 
with costs, and a n offer to settle without paying their costs would have made no difference 
[73]-[74]. 
 
(3) Asymmetry of risk.  The Court of Appeal was concerned  by the fact  that the  uninsured 
claimants faced failing to recover their costs if they won, whereas Transform could have 
recovered its costs if they had failed [58]. However, this “asymmetry ” was not the product of 
Travelers’ interventio n. It resulted  from the fact that Transform was insolvent and largely 
uninsured , and the claimants’  liability for costs  was several -only (i.e. each  claimant was 
independently liable f or a small proportion of the overall costs) [61]-[62]; [82]. 
 
Therefore, the courts below were wrong to order  Travelers to pay the uninsured claimants ’ costs  [83]. 
 
Concurring judgment s of Lord Reed and Lord Sumption  
 
Lord Reed reviews the historical posit ion in England, Australia and New Zealand relating to third-
party costs orders [85]-[93]; [106] -[112]  and compares this to Scotland, where the courts may order The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 expenses against a third party who has acted as the “real master of the litigation” , and where  there is no 
equivalent concept to “intermeddling”  [94]-[103] . Lord Reed adds that the suggestion that a costs order 
must be “exceptional”  has little, if any, significance [106] -[112] . 
 
Lord Sumption discusses the “intermeddling”  and “real defendant”  approac hes. He suggests that cases in 
which an insurer has engaged in “intermeddling”  are likely to be rare, and an insurer who acts in good 
faith in relation to insured claims should not incur liability in costs  [113] -[116] .

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The circumstances in which a landlord may be asked to give consent under a fully qualified covenant  
are infinitely variable . In every case, the reasonableness of the landlord’s decision will be a question of 
fact and degree . This must  be assessed by reference to the facts at the date of the tenant’s request , not 
what the parties contemplated when the lease was granted  [27]-[32]. 
 
The real issue in this case i s whether the courts below were correct in construing the lease in such a 
way as to prevent the landlord from having regard to an increased risk of enfranchisement from 
residential use. Three reasons have been advanced in su pport of that conclusion [33]-[34]. 
 
The first reason ( adopted by the tenant’s counsel before the Supreme Court) is that refusal of consent 
under clause 3(19) is inconsistent with the landlord’s grant of rights under clause 3(11). The majority 
reject s this argument , holding that the two clauses must  be read together. Under clause 3(19) the 
tenant must act consistently with planning legislation; so clause 3(11) only allows residential  use of the 
building to the extent that it is permitted by the planning reg ime [34]; [36]. 
 
The sec ond reason (adopted by HHJ Collender) is that clause 3(19) serve s a limited purpose of 
protecting the landlord from liability which might arise under new planning conditions. But there  is 
nothing to suggest that there is only one pu rpose for the existence of clause 3(19). The right approach 
is to decide whether the landlord’s refusal serves a purpose which is sufficiently connected with the 
landlord and tenant relationship: [37]. 
 
The third reason (adopted by the Court of Appeal) is that it makes no sense t o allow the landlord to 
refuse planning permission to avoid the risk of enfranchisement, because a third part y could apply for 
the same planning permission free of any such restraint  and with the same adverse consequences to 
the lan dlord  [18]; [34]. It is true that the landlord was vulnerable to enfranchisement if a third party 
sought planning permission. But, as a matter of fact, no third party did apply for planning permission. 
At the time of the tenant’s request, the landlord’s ab ility to refuse consent under clause 3(19) gave the 
landlord a real measure of protection against enfranchisement [38]. 
 
So the Court of Appeal made an error of law which requires the Supreme Court to consider the 
question of reasonableness for itself [39]. The Court considers that, on the undisputed facts, the 
landlord was acting reasonably in protecting the value of its property [40]-[42]. 
 
Dissenting judgments of Lady Arden and Lord Wilson  
 
Lady Arden and Lord Wilson both rely on clause 3(11) which sugge sts the tenant may use the building 
for residential purposes. In their judgment,  this cannot be cut down by the landlord’s power to refuse 
consent to a planning application [44]; [47]; [55]-[60]. If so, this effect ively rewrite s clause 3(11) [61]-
[62]. 
 
Lady Arden reads the authorities as establishing that  the court should make an assessment of all the 
circumstances to determine whether the consent was unreasonably refused . Here, the parties cannot 
have intended that the landlord  should be able to protect i tself against the risk of increased 
enfranchisement by refusing consent to a planning application  for increased residential use [48]-[50]. 
Lord Wilson emphasises that reasonableness is fact -sensitive and considers that the Supre me Court has 
no reason to de part from the trial judge’s determination [63].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Court rejects MSCC ’s argument that, in the context of land, equitable reli ef is only available for 
forfeiture of property rights , as opposed to a right to possession under a contract . 
 
In the context of personal property (property which is not land), t he decided cases suggest that 
equitable relief is available for forfeiture of “proprietary” or “possessory rights”  [24]; [28]; [32]-[34]. On a 
proper analysis, “possessory rights”  means something falling short of ownership, or  of a proprietary 
interest [43]. 
 
Now that it is settled that equitable relief may apply to forfeiture of possessory rights in the context of 
personal property , there are powerful reasons why it should also do  so in the context of land. First, the 
doctrine of relief from forfeiture historically developed in the context of land [44]. Secondly, there is 
no logical or principled reason for distinguishing between rights ove r land and rights over other forms 
of prop erty [45]; [76]. Thirdly, MSCC ’s distinction would lead to arbitrary results. The courts should 
identify the scope for equitable intervention by taking a principled approach and consider the nature 
and purpose of i ts power to grant relief [47].  
 
The conce pt of “possessory rights”  does not lead to significant uncertainty in the law . It is frequently used 
in the context of commercial law and there is no immediately obvious reason why it should not be 
used in relation  to rights over land [41]-[42].  
 
Therefore, the Court concludes that the courts may relieve against the forfeiture of “possessory rights”  
over land. However, the majority reject s Vauxhall’s wider argument that relief from forfeiture should 
extend to all rights to use land  [50]. Lady Arden expresses no view on  this point because it was not 
fully argued and is not essential  to the appeal  [69]. 
 
On the facts, t his Licence did grant “possessory rights”  to Vauxhall. As the Court of Appeal explained,  
Vauxhall ga ined virtually exclusive possession of the Spillway and a high degree of control  over it  in 
perpetuity. As a result , Vauxhall was entitled to ask the court for relief from forfeiture  of those rights 
[46]; [48]; [56]-[57]; [89]-[90]. 
 
In her concurring judg ment, Lady Arden sets out the underlying principles  in detail [60]-[91]. On her 
approach,  the key question is not what category  of rights are at stake, but  whether the circumstances in 
which relief from forfeiture is sought to be invoked are those in which  equity would grant relief [76]-
[77]. She holds that the extension of relief from forfeiture to “possessory rights”  does not create an 
unacceptable loss of certainty [88].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
An employee who makes an invention which belongs to his  or her employer from the outset and for 
which a patent has been granted is entitled to compensation if he or she establishes: first, that the 
patent is, having regard among other things to the size and nature of the employer’s undertaking, of 
outstanding benef it to the employer; and secondly, that, by r eason of these matters, it is just that  he or 
she be awarded compensation  [30].  At least in the ordinary case , Parliament intended the term 
“employer” to mean the inventor’s actual employer  [31].  The relevant benefit is the benefit the 
inventor’s actual employer has derived or may reasonably be expected to derive from the patent, or 
from the assignment or grant to a person connected with him of any right in the invention , patent or 
patent application  [32].  In assessing the benefit derived or expected to be derived by an employer 
from an assig nment of the patent to a person connected with the employer  (the circumstances  of this 
case) , the court must consider the position  of the actual  employer and the benefit whi ch the assignee 
has in fact gained or  is exp ected to gain  [33]. The Supreme Court of t he United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
Previous cases on application s for inventor compen sation  are helpful to a point , but they provide no 
substitute for the statutory test , which requires the benefit  to be outstanding .  That  is an ordinary 
English word meaning ex ceptional  or such as to stand out and it refers to the benefit (in terms of 
money or money’s worth) of the patent to the employer rather than the degree of inventiveness of the 
employee.  It is, however, both a relative a nd qualitative term and the context must be considered [39]. 
 
An “undertaking” is a unit or entity which carries on a business activity , and here the undertaking to be 
considered is that of the company or other entity which emp loys the inventor  [41].  The correct 
approach  in identifying the relevant  undertaking is to look at the commerci al reality of the situation .  
Where  a group company operates a research facility for the benefit of the whole group and the work 
results in pate nts which are assigned to oth er group members for their benefit,  the focu s of the inquiry 
into whether any one o f those patents is of outstanding benefit to the company must be the extent of 
the benefit of that patent to the group and how that compares wit h the benefits derived by the  group 
from other patents for inven tions ari sing from the research carried out by t hat company  [48].  A 
highly material consideration is the extent of the benefit of the Shanks patents to t he Unilever group 
and how that compare s with the benefits the group  derived from other patents resulting from t he 
work carried out at CRL  [51].  The court should take into ac count matters such as the fact that a large 
undertaking might be able to harness its goodwill and sales force in a way t hat a smaller undertaking 
could not do  [53].  However, a tribunal should be very cautious before accepting a sub mission that a 
patent has not been of outstanding benefit to an employer simply because it has had no significant 
impact on  its overall profitab ility or the value of all of its sales [54]. 
 
As to the relevan ce of tax , the employee must account for any tax due on his or her fair  share and the 
employer must account for any tax due on the balance.   This approach is consonant with the legislative 
purpose of the provisions of the  1977 Act and is fairer than  an approach whi ch requires the employer 
to pay the empl oyee a share of the benefit net of tax  [58].  Separately, i f the benefit is ou tstanding, 
then the fair share of the benefit should reflect the deleterious effect on the real  value of money of the 
substantial time betw een Unilever’s receipt of the licence f ees and other moneys and its making of any 
payment of compen sation  [66].  The 1977 Act does not bar  the Comptroller from having regard to the 
impact of inflation .  This approach is not unduly complex and should not en courage delay  [67]. 
 
The hearing office r’s assessment of  the benefit of the Shanks patents  was flawed .  First, he adopted the 
wrong sta rting point.  CRL’s undertaking for the purpose s of section 40 was the busine ss of generating 
inventions and providing th ose inventions and the patents which pr otected them to Unilever for use in 
connection with it s business  [79].  Secondly, the hearing officer’s parti cular focus upon the overall 
turno ver and profits generated by U nilever  was mi sdirected [80].  Thirdly, it c annot be said that the 
size and success  of Unilever’s business as a whole played any material part in securing the benefit it has 
enjoyed from the Shanks patents , and  the hearing off icer failed to take into accou nt relevant matters  
[81].  Fourthly,  the hea ring officer wrongly  adopted an approac h which involved assessing the extent 
and nature of the benefit derived from a patent simply by comparing it to the patent owner’s overall 
turnover or profits  [82].  The hearing office r’s decision must be set aside [84].  The benefit Unilever 
enjoyed from the Shanks  patents was outstanding within the meaning of section 40  [85]. 
 
Mr Justice Ar nold was wrong to find that 3% would  have represented a  fair share of the benefit 
Unilever enjoyed from the Shanks patents  [90].  It would  not be appropriate to interfe re with the 
hearing officer ’s conclusion that 5% would have been a fair  share  [91].  The fair share to which 
Professor Shanks is entitled is £2 m and the appeal is allowed [92-93].

The Supreme Court unani mously allows  the appeal  and remits the case to the E mployment Tribunal 
on the ba sis that the appellant is entitled to claim the protection of Par t IVA of the 1996 Act . Lady 
Hale gives the judgment.     
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
‘Worker’ under domestic law  
The appellant argued that she is a ‘limb (b )’ worker  under the definition in s 230(3)  of the 1996 Act: 
namely that she works under a contract whe reby she ‘undertakes to do or perform personally  any work 
or services for another party to the contract who se status is not by virtue of the contract  that of a 
client or customer of any profession or busine ss’ she is  undertaking  [2-3].  
 
The issue is whether the appellant ’s work is per formed p ursuant to a contract with the re cipient of that 
work or services, or pursuant to som e different legal arrangem ent. Judges hold a statutory office , and 
office -holders do not necessarily hold office pursuant to a contrac t [12]. It depends on the intention of 
the parties, which is reflected in the manner of engagement , the source  and character of the rules 
governing service and the over all context [16]. In the appellant ’s case, the essentia l components of the 
relationship ar e derived from statute and not a matter  for neg otiation; it is difficult to identify her 
employer ; and the separation of powers is a f actor agains t a contract between a Minister of the Crown 
and a  member of the judiciary . Taken together , these fac tors d o not suggest a cont ractual relationship  
[17-21]. 
 
Nor are judge s in Crown em ployment. They  are not civil servants or the equivalent  of civil serv ants. 
They  do not work under o r for the purposes of  the functions  of the  Lord C hief Ju stice, but for the 
administration of jus tice in accordance with their oaths of office  [22-25]. 
 
Human rights  
The imposition of detr iments, such as the bullying, victimisatio n and failure to t ake complaints 
seriously  which the appellant alleges, would be an interference with her r ight to  freedom of speech  
under  article 10 ECHR  [26]. A claim  under the Human Rights Act 1998  (‘the HRA’) would not enable  
the appellant to seek the wider relief  that a worker could under  Part IVA of the 1996 Act [27, 30]. The 
failure to  extend th e Part IVA  protection s to judicial of fice-holders is a violation of the appellant ’s 
right under article 14 not to be discriminated  against in her enjoyment of  the right s under the ECHR : 
(i) the facts  of her c ase are within  the ambit of article  10; (ii) she has been tre ated less favourably tha n 
other employees and work ers who make responsible  public interest disclo sures; (iii) her occupational 
classification is clearly  a ‘status’ within the meaning of article 14; and (iv) exclusion of j udges is not a 
proportionate means  of achieving a legitimate aim. T here is no evidence that either the execu tive or 
Parliament addressed their minds to the exclusion  of the judicia ry from the prote ction of Part IVA and 
no legitimate aim has been put forward  [28-37]. 
 
The remedy for th e incompatibility of the exclusion of the judiciary from the protection of Part IVA 
of the 1996 Act with the rights under the ECHR is found  in the obligation on the courts in s 3 of the 
HRA  to read and give effect to primary legislation  in a way which is compatible with those rights . It 
has been established  that it is possible to interpret the definition of a ‘limb (b )’ worker to include 
judicial office -holders when required to do so by  EU law , and it would not ‘go against the grain ’ of the 
1996 Act  to do so in respect of the protecti ons of Part IVA . This interpretation  shoul d also apply to 
the equivalent provision s in the Employme nt Righ ts (Nort hern Irel and) Order 1996  [39-45].   
 
Accordingly the appeal  is allowed and the  case is remitted to the Employ ment T ribunal  on the basis 
that the appellant  is entitled to claim the protection of Part IVA of the  1996 Act  [46].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Article 56 prohibits all restrictions on payments or the movement of capital between member states , and 
between member states and third countries.  It is common ground between the parties that article 56 
applies to gifts to charities and that Jersey is not a member s tate. The issue  therefore  turns on whether 
Jersey is to be regarded as a third country [7].  
 
The Bailiwick of Jersey is a Crown Dependency which, along with the other Channel Islands, enjoy s a 
unique relationship with the U nited Kingdom  through the Crown  [8]. Jersey is not an independent state 
in international law; the UK government is responsible for its international relations and has the power 
to extend to Jersey the operation of a treaty concluded by the U nited Kingdom  [10]. Article 29 of the 
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 provides that a treaty is binding upon each party in 
respect of its entire territory unless a different intention is expressed [11]. Article 299(1) EC (no w article 
355 TFEU ) makes express provision for the territorial scope of EU law  [13]. Protocol 3 to the Treaty 
of Accession 1972 provides that the free movement of goods applies to the Channel Islands  [14]. 
However, other rules of EU law do not apply in Jersey, including the EU rules on free movement o f 
capital [15].  
 
Decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “ CJEU ”) provide a system atic and 
consistent approach to this issue. The question  of whether a territory is to be regarded as a t hird country 
is context -specific and will depend on whether, under the relevant  Treaty of Accession and 
supplementary mea sures, the relevant provisions of EU law apply to that territory [35]. The decision of 
Prunus SARL v Directeur des services fiscaux (Case C -384/09) [2011] I -ECR 3319 , in which the CJEU held  
that the British Virgin Islands were to be treated as third countries , is determinative of the issue  in the 
present case  [36]. Jersey is to be considered a third cou ntry for the purpose of a transfer of capital from 
the U nited Kingdom  [37]. 
 
Accordingly,  EU rules on the free movement of capital do apply to transfers of capital between the 
United Kingdom  and Jersey , and it i s accepted that the refusal of relief under s ection 23 is a restriction 
on that free movement. The remaining question is therefore whether the restriction is justifiable under 
EU law [38]. 
 
On its face, s ection 23 does not impose any restriction on the free movement of capital  and is therefore  
compliant with article 56 [50]. The only restriction is that imposed by the judicial gloss placed on the 
words now found in s ection 989 of the Income Tax Act 2007 by the House of Lords in Camille and Henry 
Dreyfus Foundation Inc v Inland Revenue Comrs [1956] AC 39  (“Dreyfus ”) a restriction which, when 
incorporated into section 23 , has the effect of confining relief under that provision to trusts governed 
by the law of a part of the United K ingdom and subject to the jurisdiction of the UK courts . There can 
be no doubt  that the Dreyfus  gloss on s ection 989, as applied to section  23, is incompatible with article 
56. It is plain that the restriction of relief from inheritance tax to trusts governed by the law of a part of 
the U nited Kingdom  cannot be justified under EU law  [51]. Article 56 is directly applicable and must be 
given effect in priority to inconsistent national law, whether judicial or legislative in origin. The Dreyfus 
gloss on section 989 cannot be applied to s ection 23 in situations falling within the scope of article 56. 
Since it is undisputed that the Coulter Trust satisfied the conditions at the time, it follows that it qualifies 
for the relief [52].

 with the issue of secure accommodation which arose during the hearing. Lady Arden agree s with Lady 
Hale on the effec t of article 5  in a further judg ment . Lord Lloyd -Jones  agrees wit h Lord Carnwath ’s 
dissen ting judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The case turn s on the inter -relationship between the conce pt of parental responsibility, as defined by 
the Children Act 1989, the common law and other  relevant statutory provisi ons, and th e obligation of 
the State to pro tect th e human ri ghts of children under the ECHR  [19]. 
 
Historically, p arental rights under domestic law were never absolute and became increasingly  subject to 
the overriding consideration of the child ’s own welfare.  The power of ph ysical  control was  a dwin dling 
right as the child acquired  sufficient understanding and intell igence  to make his or her own decisions  - 
the age of discretion  - which could be before the age of majority  (known as ‘Gillick competence ’ after 
the case of Gillick v West  Norfolk and Wisbe ch AHA  [1986] 1 AC 112 ) [21-23]. Gillick  is not directly 
relevant to the question of whether parent al authority endure s beyond the age of discretion , if the child 
lacks capacity to make decision s [24, 69 -72]. The MCA  does not override oth er common  law and 
statutory provisions relating to 16 and 17 -year-old child ren, but it does indicate an appr eciation of the 
different needs of this age group  [27, 71]. Lady Black would hold  that as a matt er of common  law, 
parental responsi bility for a chil d of 16 o r 17 does not extend to authoris ing a confinement of the child 
in circumstance s amounting to a deprivation of liberty  [88-90]. Lady Hale prefers not to express a 
concluded view on thi s question  but agree s that it reinforces the co nclusion reached under the  ECHR 
[28].  
 
Article  5 ECHR protects children who lack the capacity to  make decisions for themselves from being 
arbitrarily deprived of their liberty . Clearly the degree of supervision to which D was subject at the 
placemen ts was  not normal for a  child of  16 or 17  [39]. D’s living arrangem ents had to be compared 
with those of  children of the same age without disabilit ies, and the fact that they were made  in his best 
interests d id not mean he was not deprived of  his liberty [41]. Parental consent c ould not substitute for 
the subjective requirement under ar ticle 5 for valid consent to the deprivation [42]. The pro cedural 
requireme nts of article 5 applied (and had in fact been complied with  by the court authorisation s) [44]. 
Human rig hts are about the  relation ship between private persons and the state, and D’s deprivation of 
liberty in the pla cements was attr ibutable to the state [46]. There is no scope for the o peration  of 
parental responsibility to authorise what would otherwise be a  violation of a f undamenta l human right 
of a child  [49]. 
 
The question wa s raised in the hearing of whether the provisions of  s 25 Children Act 1989 , regarding 
the p lacing of children in acco mmodation provided for the purpose of restricting liberty , apply to D’s 
living arr angements . Lady Black addresses th is issue  in her judg ment , concluding that a narrow 
construction of s 25 is needed to ensure  local authorities c an meet the welfare needs  and best interes ts 
of children who for good reasons need t o be kept in confined circu mstances , but that s 25 d oes not 
play a direct role in D ’s case [100, 113-115].  
 
Lord Carnwath, dissenting, would have agreed with the Court of Appeal that nothing in the MCA 
detract s from the common law p rinciple  of parental responsibili ty in respect of 16 and 17 -year-olds 
[145] . He further consider s that the case law of the E uropean Court o f Human R ights on article 5 
recognise s that the proper exercise of parental resp onsibility  can include consent to confinement  of a 
child such as D [155].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows t he app eal. Lord Sales gives the sole judgment, with which all 
members of the Court agree.    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The basic  scheme for allocation of jurisdiction under the Recast Regulation  is that persons domiciled 
in a member state  of the European U nion should generally be sued in that member state ( by article 4), 
but they may also be sued in another  member state  in certain situations , including in cases of exclusive 
jurisdiction specified under article 24  [20]. The cases of exclusive jurisdiction wi thin a rticle 24 reflect  
situations where there is an especially strong and fixed connection between the subject matter of a 
dispute and the courts of a particular member state  [24]. The principle of exclusive jurisdiction 
supersedes the other principles un derlyi ng the Recast Regulation, including the domiciliary principle of  
jurisdiction  (under article 4) and the principle of respect for party autonomy  [25].  
 
Given the scheme of the Recast Regulation , in principle, there should be only one correct applicat ion 
of article 24 in relation to a given claim  [28]. The interpretation and application of article 24  cannot 
depend  on an evaluative judgment in which different courts could reasonably take different views  [28]. 
This is consistent  with the objective s of setting highly predictable rules on the allocation of jurisdiction 
and avoid ing inconsistent judgments on the same issue by the courts of different member states  [29]. 
 
Decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, particularly  Hassett v South Eas tern H ealth 
Board  (Case C -372/07) [2008] ECR I -7403 and Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe v JP Morgan Bank Chase Bank NA  
(Case C -144/10) [2011] 1 WLR 2087 , show that article 24(2) is to be construed narrowly , as an 
exception to the gen eral domiciliary  principle , and sho uld not be given an interpretation broader than 
required by its objective  [31-32, 40-41]. These decisions  also stress the  importance of arriving at an 
interpretation which avoid s the risk of inconsistent decisions  [39].  
 
Therefore, the  interpretation of a rticle 24(2) adopted by the Court of Appeal  cannot be sustained . An 
evaluative assessment of proceedings relating to a specific claim may show that a particular aspect of 
the claim , involv ing an assessment of the validity  of decisions of a company’s organs , is so linked with 
other features of the claim that it is not the “principal subject matter” of those proceedings, as required  
by article 24(2).  Where there are two distinct claims  – one, by itself, falling within artic le 24(2) and the 
other, by itself, n ot falling within article 24(2) – it is not legitimate to maintain that by an overall 
evaluative judgment as to both claims taken together the second also fall s within article 24(2) , giving  
the English courts exclusive j urisdiction . A mere link between the  two claims is not sufficient. [33-34] 
 
On issue (1), i n this case, the English company law claim and the authority claim are connected  in a 
sense, but they are distinct claims which are not inextricably bound up togethe r. The English company 
law claim can  be brought and made good on its own terms without  regard to  the authority claim , as 
can t he authority claim. Assessing the authority claim as a distinct set of proceedings, clearly the 
principal subject matter does not comprise the validity of the decisio ns of the organs of a company 
with its seat in England. That interpretation and application of article 24(2) is acte clair . The English 
courts  thus lack article 24(2) jurisdiction over Koza Altin and the trustees  as to that claim . [35, 43] 
 
On issue (2), s ince article 24(2) does not cover the authority claim, the English courts lack article 24(2) 
jurisdiction in relation to the trustees with respect to that claim. The proceedings against the trustees 
are principally conc erned with the authority claim . Artic le 24(2) jurisdiction over the  English company 
law claim  cannot extend to the trustees, who are not necessary parties to that cla im. [45]

The Supreme Court  unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Hodge  gives the sole judgment with 
which the other Justices agree.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Supreme Court considered the Principal VAT Directive [11-16], the Value Added Tax Act 1994 
[17-19] and the relevant CJEU case law  [25-64]. It deriv ed the following propositions  [65]: 
 
(1) As VAT is a tax on the value added by the taxable person, the VAT system relieves the taxable 
person of the burden of VAT payable or paid in the course of that person ’s economic activity and 
thus avoids double taxation.  
(2) There must be a direct and immediate link between the goods and services which the taxable 
person has acquired (in other words the particular input transaction) and the taxable supplies 
which that person makes (in other words its particular output transaction). This link  gives rise to 
the right to deduct. The needed link exists if the acquired goods and services are part of the cost 
components of that person’s taxable transactions which utilise tho se goods and services . 
(3) Alternatively, there must be a direct and immediate link between those acquired goods and services 
and the whole of the taxable person’s economic activity because their cost forms part of that 
business’s overheads and thus a comp onent part of the price of its products . 
(4) Where the taxable person acquires professional services for an initial fund -raising transaction 
which is outside the scope of VAT, that use of the services does not prevent it from deducting the 
VAT payable on t hose services as input tax and retaining that deduction if its purpose in fund -
raising, objectively ascertained, was to fund its economic activity and it later uses the funds raised 
to develop its business of providing taxable supplies. The same may apply if an analogous 
transaction involving the sale of shares is classified as an exempt transaction . 
(5) Where the cost of the acquired services, including services relating to fund -raising, are a cost 
component of downstream activities of the taxable person w hich are either exempt transactions or 
transactions outside the scope of VAT, the VAT paid on such services is not deductible as input 
tax. Where the taxable person carries on taxable transactions, exempt transactions and transactions 
outside the scope of VAT, the VAT paid on the services it has acquired has to be apportioned . 
(6) The right to deduct VAT as input tax arises immediately when the deductible tax becomes 
chargeable . As a result, there may be a time lapse between the deduction of the input tax and the 
use of the acquired goods or services in an output transaction. Furthe r, if the taxable person 
acquired the goods and services for its economic activity but, as a result of circumstances beyond 
its control, it is unable to use them in the context of taxable transactions, the taxable person retains 
its entitlement to deduct . 
(7) The purpose of the taxable person in carrying out the fund -raising is a question of fact which the 
court determines by having regard to objective evidence. The existence of a link between the fund -
raising transaction and the person’s taxable activity i s to be assessed in the light of the objective 
content of the transaction . The  ultimate question is whether the taxable person is acting as such for 
the purposes of an economic activity. This is a question of fact which must be assessed in the light 
of all  the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the asset concerned and the period 
between its acquisition and its use for the purposes of the taxable person’s economic activity . 
 
In light of the foregoing, t he Court considers that  FASL , when it in curred the costs of the SFPE units , 
was acting as a taxable person because it was acquiring assets in support of its current and planned 
economic activities , namely fa rming and the windfarm . On that basis, FASL was entitled to an 
immediate right of deducti on of the VAT paid on the purchase of the SFPE units and is entitled to 
retain that deduction or repayment so long as it uses the SFPs which it received as cost components of 
its economic activities . Moreover, on the facts founds, FASL  does not carry out a nd does not propose 
to carry out downstream non -economic activities or exempt transactions. Therefore, no question of 
apportionment arises  [68].

 before  the judge and referred to in the cour se of th e trial to th e Forum (at the Forum ’s expense) in 
accordance with the principles laid down in the judgment.     
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Rule 5.4C refers to  the records of the court. The CPR do  not define this term or provide what the 
records of the court are to contain . The essence of a record i s something which is kept. It must 
therefore refer to documents kept for the c ourt’s own purp oses, presently at least  the claim form and 
the judgments or orders which re sulted, but not every document lodged or held for the time being at 
court . However current practice in record ke eping cannot determine the scope of the cour t’s power  to 
order access t o ma terials to non -parties, which is info rmed by the principle of open justice , not the 
practical requirements of running a justice system  [19-24].  
 
The constitutional principle of open justice  applies to all courts and tribunal s exercis ing the j udicial 
power of the state . They all  have inherent jurisdiction to determine what th at principle requ ires in 
terms of access to documents  or other info rmation place d before th em. The extent of any access 
permitted by  the court’s rules is not deter minative (except wh ere they contain a valid prohibition ) [41]. 
The principal purposes of the open justic e principle are two -fold: to hold individual  courts and ju dges 
to account , and to enable  the public to under stand how the justice system works and why d ecisions are 
taken . Now that much more of the argument and evidence is reduced to writing before a hearing it is 
difficult for non -parties to follow what is going on without access to the written material, including 
documents [42-43].  The default  position  is that the public  should be allowed access , not only  to the 
parties’ submissions an d arguments, but also to the documents which ha ve been placed before the 
court and refer red to during the hearing, which are not limited to those the ju dge has be en asked to or 
has said that  he has read [44].  
 
It does n ot follow, however, that an applicant has a right for access to be gr anted  (save to t he extent 
that the rules gr ant s uch a right) . A non -party seeking a ccess must explain why he seeks it and how 
granting acce ss will advance the  open justice principle. The co urt will carry out a fact -specific balancing 
exercise to take account of any counte rvailing princip les, such as the need to p rotect national security, 
privacy interests or commercial confidentiali ty. The practicalities and pr oportionality of granting the 
request will also be relevant , especially when proceedings are over [45-47]. 
 
In the present a ppeal  and c ross-appeal , both parties ’ submissions  are therefore  incorrect. The Court of 
Appeal did have inherent jurisdiction to mak e the order it did , to support the open justice princip le, 
and it could have made a w ider order if it were right to do  so. The basis for the order is not Rule 5.4C  
[49]. There seems no rea listic possibility of the judge making a  more lim ited order than the  Court of 
Appeal , so th e orders for access already made will stand, whi le the balan ce of the application be listed 
before the  trial judge (or another Hig h Court judge if that is not possible ) to determine whether  the 
court shoul d require  Cape to provide a copy of any other document placed before the judge and 
referred to in the cour se of the trial to the Forum, at the Forum’s expense, in acco rdance with the 
principles laid down in the judgment [50].  
 
By wa y of post script, the Su preme Cou rt urges the bodies  responsible for fra ming the court rules in 
each part of the United Kingdom to give consideration to and consult on  the quest ions of princip le 
and pr actice raised by this case [51].

THE QUESTIONS REFERRED  
 
For the  purposes of this reference, the Court of Justice of the European Union is asked to assume that 
guidance by a member of the hotel’s staff of Mrs X to the reception was a service within the “holiday 
arrangements” which Kuoni had contracted to provide and th at the rape and assault constituted 
improper performance of the contract  [22]. 
 
In order to determine this appeal,  specifically in relation to the second issue identified above,  the 
Supreme Court refers the following questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union  [23]: 
 
(1) Where there has been a failure to perform or an improper performance of the obligations arising 
under the contract of an organizer or retailer with a con sumer to provide a package holiday to 
which the Directive applies, and that failure to perform or improper performance is the result of 
the actions of an employee of a hotel company which is a provider of services to which that 
contract relates:  
 
(a) is there scope for the application of the defence set out in the second part of the third 
alinea to article 5(2); and, if so,  
 
(b) by which criteria is the national court to assess whether that defence applies?  
 
(2) Where an organizer or retailer enters into a contract with a consumer to provide a package 
holiday to which the Directive  applies, and where a hotel company provides services to which 
that contract relates, is an employee of that hotel company himself to b e considered a “supplier 
of services” for the purposes of the defence under article 5(2), third alinea of the Directive?

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
For the purposes of this reference, the Court of Justice of the European Union is asked to assume that 
the claimant appellants’ interpretation of section 9 of the 1990 Act is correct, and that  a Justice of the 
Peace has power to give a ruling which may result in an award of compensation if he considers that a 
health mark ought to have been applied to a carcass.  
In order to determine this appeal, this Court refers the following questions to the  Court of Justice of 
the European Union  [22]: 
(1) Do Regulations (EC) Nos 854 and 882 preclude a procedure whereby pursuant to 
section 9 of the 1990 Act a Justice of the Peace decides on the merits of the case and on the 
basis of the evidence of experts ca lled by each side whether a carcass fails to comply with food 
safety requirements?  
(2) Does Regulation (EC) No 882 mandate a right of appeal in relation to a decision of an 
OV under article 5.2 of Regulation (EC) No 854 that the meat of a carcass was unfit  for human 
consumption and, if it does, what approach should be applied in reviewing the merits of the 
decision taken by the OV on an appeal in such a case?

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeal  in the limited sense o f interpreting the relevant 
legal provisions differently from the Inner House . The respondent’s claim will now return to the FTT 
for determination in accordance with this interpretation. The judgment is given by Lady Black.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The q ualitative issue  
 
The activity of ‘engaging with people face to face’ can take many differing forms, as can the form of 
the assistance that is needed for the claimant’s engagement to occur [29-30]. A narrow and technical 
approach to the words ‘social suppo rt’ in descriptor 9c is unwarranted; it is inconsistent with the 
government’s objective of creating a benefit which is easier to understand and reaches those who need 
extra support to live independently and participate in everyday life [32]. What brings th e claimant 
within descriptor 9c rather than 9b is that, to be able to engage with others, he or she needs the 
support to come from someone  ‘trained or experienced in assisting people to engage in social 
situations ’ i.e. the support will only be effective if delivered by someone who is not just familiar with 
the claimant, but also trained/experienced  in assisting engagement in social situations [ 34-35].  
 
Careful scrutiny of the facts will sometimes be necessary in order to determine  whether descriptor 9c 
applies , including probing the information provided by sensitive questions [38] and, where support is  
already being p rovided by family/friends , exploring how they have come to know what to do, whether 
that help could come from any well -meaning friend or fam ily member , and what additional help (if 
any) is required [37].   
 
The timing issue  
 
It is helpful to consider examples of practical ways in which a person can be helped to engage face to 
face with others. For instance, p reparation prior to the engagement m ight avoid overwhelming 
psychological distress , and , during the engagement, a supporter might be able to give the claimant 
reminders, direct the conversation away from topics that trigger anxiety, give private signs of 
reassurance, or recognise the need to  remove the claimant from the meeting [40]. The Secretary of 
State’s insistence on it being necessary for the supporter to be present at the engagement would stand 
in the way of means of support which do not involve physical presence and would be likely to  impede 
attempts to improve the claimant’s abilities to handle matters in future with less support [41]. It would 
be undesirable to construe descriptor 9c in a way that runs counter to these considerations, and there 
is nothing in the wording of the descri ptor to require that . The word ‘needs’ indicates a continuing 
need, to be found “as respects every time ” over the 12 month period made relevant by s 81 of the  Act, 
but it does not , of itself,  exclude the possibility of assistance outside the confines of th e engagement 
[43] and nor is there anything else to dictate such an interpretation  [45]. Given that social support is 
likely to take many different forms, depending on the individual needs of the claimant, it is undesirable 
to attempt to prescribe in the a bstract which other forms of support will be sufficient. It will be a 
question of fact and degree [46], addressed with close attention to the words of the descriptor and the 
required period condition [48]. 
 
The Inner House’s acceptance that a ‘temporal or causal link’ was required between the help given and 
the activity should not be adopted. It is difficult to see how support which is linked in time to a face to 
face engagement but has no causal link to what occurs could have any relevance  [47].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeal . The certificate shou ld be amended to exclude uses

judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Section 73 of the 1990 Act envisages two situations: either (a) the grant of a new permissio n 
unconditionally or subject to revised conditions, or (b) refusal of permission, leaving the existing 
permission in place with its conditions unchanged. It does not say what is to happen if the authority 
wishes to change some conditions but leave others i n place. Government guidance indicating that “to 
assist with clarity” planning decisions under section 73 “should also repeat the relevant conditions The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 from the original planning permission” was given as advice, rather than as a statement about the legal 
position [13].  
 
Whatever the legal character of the document in question, the starting point for interpretation is to 
find “the natural and ordinary meaning” of the words there used, viewed in their particular context and 
in the light of common sense [19]. 
 
The 2014 permission needs to be seen through the eyes of a reasonable reader, who is assumed to start 
by taking the document at face value [28]. The wording o f the operative part of the grant are clear and 
unambiguous. The Council approves an application f or “the variation of condition as set out below”, 
which is followed by precise and accurate descriptions of the relevant development, of the condition to 
be varied, and of the permission under which it was imposed. That is followed by statements of the 
“Original wording”, then of the “Proposed wording”, the latter stating in terms that the store is to be 
used fo r the sale of non -food goods only. The obvious and only natural interpretation of those parts of 
the docume nt is that the Council was approving what  was applied for: the variation of one condition 
from the original wording to the proposed wording, in effect substituting one for the other. There is 
nothing to indicate an intention to discharge the condition altogether, or to remove the restriction on 
the sale of food goods [29].  
 
If section 73 gave no power to grant a permission in the form described, the logical consequence 
would be that there was no valid grant at all, not that there was a valid grant free from the proposed 
condition . There is no iss ue now as to the validity of the grant as such , and all parties agree there was a 
valid permission for something. That being the common position, the document must be taken as it is  
[32]. It has been normal and accepted usage to describe section 73 as conf erring power to “vary” or 
“amend” a condition, so the reasonable reader would not see any difficulty in giving effect to the 2014 
permission  in the manner authorised by the section – i.e. as the grant of a new permission subject to 
the condition as varied.  The absence of a reason for the condition does not affect its validity [33].  
 
There are some internal inconsistencies in the second part of the notice, but reading the document as a 
whole, the second part can be given a sensible meaning without undue dis tortion. It is explanatory of 
and supplementary to the first part. The permitted development incorporating the amended condition 
is acceptable but only subject to the other conditions set out. In other words, they are additional 
conditions [34-35].  
 
This appeal is not concerned with the status of the conditions in the 2010 permission, but the court’s  
provisional view is that the 2010 conditions were not incorporated into the new permission, but 
continued to have effect under the 2010 permission, so far as they are consistent with anything in the 
new grant. The conditions remain valid and binding because there was nothing in the new permission 
to affect their continued operation [37-38]. 
 
Nothing in the present judgment is intended to detract from the advice , contained in the decision by 
Sullivan J in R (Reid) v Secretary of State for Transport [2002] EWHC 2174 (Admin),  at paragraph 59,  that 
“it is highly desirable that all the conditions to which the new planning permission will b e subject 
should be restated  in the new permission and not left to a process of cross -referencing” [42].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Issue (1): Sco pe of appli cation of the restraint of trade doctrine  
 
The restraint of trade doctrine is one of the earliest products of the comm on law , and reflects  the 
central importance ascribed to the freedom to work  [22]. By the early 20th century, it was recognised 
that different  considerations app lied to restraints on the seller of a business  from those on an            
ex-employee  [27]. The question of the width of the doctrine  has arisen , particular ly in Esso Petroleum Co 
Ltd v Harper’s Garage (Stourport ) Ltd [1968] AC 269  (HL) , which remains the key decision  [27-29]. It is 
not necessary  to decide on the outer boundaries of the doctrin e in this case  [30]. The agreement  is an 
employ ment contract , and it is agreed that c lause 13.2.3 does provide for a restr aint of trade [30]. In 
substance  as well as in form the restraint on shareholding  is part of the restraint on  Ms Tillman ’s ability 
to work after her emp loyment  with Egon Zehnder , so the doctrine applies on the facts  [33-34]. 
 
Issue (2): Proper constru ction  of the wo rds “interested in ” 
 
This issue turns on the proper understanding of the “validity principle ” in construing agreements . This 
principle proce eds on the premise t hat the parties to a contract o r other instrument will have intended 
it to be val id [38]. This Court considers that  requiring two meanings to be “equally plaus ible” or for 
there to be  “an element of amb iguity ” is unsati sfactory  [38-42]. The test of  whether the alternative 
construction is “realistic” is prefer red [42]. In the present case, the startin g point is t hat the phrase 
“engaged or concerned or interested”, adopted in clause 1 3.2.3, has long been included in standard 
precedents for th e drafting o f non -competition covenants and treated as including a shareholding 
prohibition  [51]. Egon Zehnder was unable to advance a realistic alternative construction  of the word  
“interested ” [52]. The natural meaning of the word , which includes a share holding  (large or s mall) , 
applies  [53]. Subject to severance , clause 13.2.3 is thus void as an unreason able restraint of trade  [53].   
 
Issue (3) : Correct approach to severance in restraint  of trade cases  
 
On the question of severance, this Court is faced with two main differing approach es, found in 
particular  in the decisions in Attwood v Lamont [1920] 3 K B 571 (CA)  and Beckett  Investment Management 
Group Ltd v Hall [2007] ICR 1539  (CA)  [57-73]. The Attwood approach  limits severance to situations 
where the  covenant is in effect a combination of  different covenants [66]. By contrast, t he Beckett 
approach  uses three cr iteria  for severance [73]. This Court prefers the Beckett approach , provides  
guidance  on its application  and overrules the decision of the Court of Appeal in Attwood [81-91].  
 
On the  Becket t approach, the first criterion is whether the unenforce able provi sion is capable of being 
removed with out the necessity of adding to or modifying the wording of what remains  – this is the so -
called “blue pencil” test  [85]. The second  criterion  is that the remaining terms continue to be 
supported by adequate co nsideratio n [86]. This will not usually be in dispute [86]. The third c riterion 
is that the r emoval of the unenforceable provision does not so change the character of the contract 
that it becomes not the sort of contract that the parties entered into at al l [87]. This is the crucial 
criterion but this Court prefers to express it as being whether remov al of the provision would not 
generate any major change in the overall  effect of all the po st-employmen t restraints in the contract  
[87]. It is for the employe r to estab lish this , and the focus is on the legal effect of the restraints  and 
not their perhaps changing significance for the parties  [87].  
 
On the facts, the words “or interested ” are capable of being removed from clause 13.2.3 without the 
need to  add to or modify the wording of the r est of the clause  and removal of the prohibition against 
her being “intereste d” would not generate any major change  in the overall effect of the restraints [88].

The Supreme Court  unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Lloyd -Jones and Lord Sales  give the sole 
judgment with which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
(1) Is the decision to extend the WRS open to challenge on grounds of proportionality?  The Secretary of State submits 
that the extension of the WRS did not interfere wi th or derogate from any pre -existing protected interest , 
so it was not subject to any requirement of proportionality  under EU law  [27]. The Court considers that 
the question at the heart of this issue is whether the Act of Accession created relevant protectable 
interests by conferring rights of EU citizenship on the new EU citizens from the A8 States subject to 
initial, tapering exceptions imposed by the existing member states, or whether it should be rega rded as 
providing for only such rights as may be conferred by the existing member states during the transitional 
period. The House of Lords in Zalewska v Department for Social Development  [2008] UKHL 67  took the 
former view [32]. The Court agrees. It consi ders that  there was no intention under the Act of Accession 
to confer an unfettered right to derogate from general principles of freedom of movement. On the 
contrary, derogation from those principles must be subject to the principle of proportionality in E U law 
[35]. This conclusion  is supported by the scheme of the relevant instruments  [33] and the purpose of 
the measures  [35]. 
 
(2) If the decision to extend the WRS is open to challenge on grounds of proportionality, did the Upper Tribunal and the 
Court of Appeal err in their approach and conclusion on this issue? It is significant that the Secretary of State has 
simply relied upo n what is said in the MAC report of April 2009. She has not filed evidence to explain 
any distinct reasoning as to why the extension of the WRS was justified, nor to point to any additional 
relevant factors other than those taken into account by the MAC in  its report [49]. This poses problems 
for the Secretary of State because the MAC was not asked to consider whether an extension of the WRS 
would be proportionate in terms of EU law and it expressed no view about that [50]. 
 
The leading decision of this Court on the principle of proportionality in EU law is now R (Lumsdon) v 
Legal Services Board [2015] UKSC 41 [57]. This explains that the principle applies according to a three 
stage test. As regards the first stage  of this test, the  Court considers that the continuation of the WRS  is 
suitable or appropriate to achieve the objective pursued  [66]. The MAC report showed that extending 
the WRS would have a material, though small, effect in mitigating the serious disturbances to the UK 
labour market by reducing th e flow of workers from A8 States which would otherwise occur  [68]. No 
issue arises in relation to the second stage. However,  the Court finds that the third stage  of the The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 proportionality analysis ( sometimes called “ proportionality stricto sensu ”) is not satisfied. According to 
the assessment in 2009  the extension of the WRS would have only a small and rather speculative 
mitigating effect in relation to the serious disturbances in the UK’s labour market, as found by the MAC, 
whereas the burdens and  detriments it would impose on employers and A8 nationals working in the UK 
were substantial and serious [70]. The result is that the extension of the WRS in 2009 was a 
disproportionate measure which was unlawful under EU law [74]. 
 
On the basis of the Cou rt’s rulings on Issues 1 and 2, the appeal falls to be dismissed.  
 
(3) If the Secretary of State succeeds on Issue 1 or Issue 2, does article 17(1)(a) of the Citizens Directive require a perso n 
to show that, throughout the period of continuous residence, s he enjoyed a right of residence under that Directive?  Although 
resolution of this issue is not necessary for the determination of the present appeal, the Court considers 
that it should deal with it  since the interpretation of article 17(1)(a) may be import ant in other cases  [79]. 
The Court concludes  that, on a textual interpretation of  the relevant provisions,  the concept of residence 
as referred to in article 17(1)(a) is factual residence [81]. This interpretation is reinforced by the purpose 
of the Citizens Directive , which is to enhance existing rights of free movement and residence and not to 
subject them to new restrictive  conditions  [82]. For these reasons,  the Upper Tribunal  arrived at a 
correct interpretation of article 17(1) in holding that re sidence in article 17(1) refers to factual residence 
rather than “legal residence”  in the specific sense which that term bears in the context of the Citizens 
Directive  [92]. 
 
(4) If article 17 of the Citizens Directive requires “legal residence” in the rel evant sense, is actual residence sufficient for the 
purposes of the 2006 Regulations?  As the Court holds that the term “residence” in article 17(1)(a) has the 
meaning set out above, this issue does not arise  [93].  
 
For the reasons set out  in the judgment , the Court would dismiss the Secretary of State’s appeal [94].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  HMRC’s appeal  against the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that 
HMRC has th e power to permit temporary trading under section 88C  of the 1979 Act . It unanimously 
dismisses the wholesalers’ appeal against the Court of Appeal’s determination that HMRC do es not 
have that power  under section 9 of the 2005 Act.  Lady Black gives the jud gment of the court. Lord 
Hughes gives a concurring judgment, with which Lord Sumption agrees.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Issue 1 A – the powers of HMRC under section 88C of the 1979 Act  
 
HMRC has concluded that the wholesalers were not fit and proper, regar dless of any conditions that 
could be imposed, including a time limit on the approval. In those circumstances, HMRC do not have 
the power to grant temporary approval pending appeal. If the person is not fit and proper for even a 
limited period , that holds good whatever purpose the time limited approval would be designed to 
achieve. The Court of Appeal was right to conclude that considerations of hardship and the impact of 
maintaining the decision on the efficacy of the appeal were not material to the evalua tion under section 
88C of whether a person is “fit and proper”  [38]. HMRC’s former practice of continuing approval 
during a winding down period does not prove the existence of the power for which the wholesalers 
contend [40].  
 
Issue 1B – the powers of HMR C under section 9 of the 2005 Act  
 
Section 9 permits HMRC to do anything which they think necessary or expedient in connection with, 
or incidental or conducive to, the exercise of their functions  [42]. It is not concerned with ancillary 
powers that undermi ne or contradict those functions. Recourse cannot be had to section 9 to provide 
an alternative route to time limited approval, supplementing section 88C in the way that the 
wholesalers suggest. This is not only because section 88C itself only permits auth orisation under that 
section, but also because of the attributes of the whole scheme of which section 88C forms a part [45]. 
By using section 9 powers to enter a wholesaler on the register, HMRC would appear to be holding out 
as fit and proper a person in relation to whom they have formed the opposite view  [46]. The fact that 
HMRC’s decision is subject to an appeal is not a proper foundation upon which to conclude that it is 
necessary or expedient, incidental or conducive, to the exercise of their functions  to assume a power to 
grant temporary approval [48].  
 
Issue 2 – High Court powers  
 
In the Court of Appeal,  it was common ground that the High Court has the power to grant injunctive 
relief to assist a wholesaler pending his appeal to the FTT, but there wa s a dispute as to the basis on 
which relief could be granted [50]. The two judges at first instance were not satisfied that the evidence 
in support of injunctive relief was sufficient, and the wholesalers did not have permission to appeal to 
the Supreme Co urt in relation to the circumstances in which the High Court may grant injunctive relief 
[61-63]. The question that arose during the hearing was what form the High Court’s order could 
legitimately take, where a case for injunctive relief was made out [64]. If the High Court orders HMRC 
to grant temporary approval to the wholesaler where HMRC has concluded that the wholesaler is not 
fit and proper, it would  necessarily be requiring HMRC to be satisfied of the opposite [70]. The High 
Court’s power to order a mandatory injunction is exercisable for the purpose of making a person do 
something that he has it within his powers to do, yet here there is not hing HMRC can properly do in 
the exercise of their statutory functions [71]. However, the absence of debate bet ween the parties 
makes it undesirable to make a definitive pronouncement on this matter, and the fact  that the case for 
relief was not made out  in the present case means it is unnecessary to do so [72].  
 
Lord Hughes adds that the legislation may be incomp atible with the E uropean Convention on Human 
Rights,  where traders who had an existing business when the registration scheme was introduced , and 
who are refused approval but have good grounds for appeal , might be forced out of business before 
their appeal could be determined  [77].

The Supreme Court  unanimously allows the appeal in part  (dismissing it on issue (1) , but allowing it on 
issue (2) ). Knowles J’ s order is set aside and the matter is remitted to him to determine whether the re 
was a constructive total loss . Lord Sumption gives the lead judgment, with which all  the Justices  agree.    The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Issue (1): Expenditure incurre d before n otice of abandonment  
 
The Supreme Court, agreeing with the courts below, does not accept that expenditure incurred before 
the service of the notice of abandonment falls outside the scope of costs  under  section 60(2)(ii ). [19]  
 
First, as a matte r of langu age, the references in section 60 to expenditure which “would” be incurred 
reflect the hypothetical character of the whole exercise  and not the chronology of the expenditure  [8]. 
Secondly, as a general rule, the loss under a hull and machinery po licy occurs at the time of the casualty 
and not when the measure of indemnity is ascertained  [10]. This rule applies even if the loss developed 
after the time of the casualt y, unless it developed as a result of a  second casualty  breaking the chain of 
causa tion [10]. Constructive total loss is a legal device for determining the measure of indemnity  [11]. 
It is a partial loss which is financially equivalent to a total loss and may be treated as either  by the 
insured  [11]. Whether there has been a constructive  total loss depends on the objective facts [12]. It 
follows from th is objective approach and the fact that the loss is suffered at the time of the casualty, 
that the damage referred to in section 60(2)(ii) is in principle the entire damage arising from the  
casualty from the moment  that it happens  [13]. The measure of that damage is its effect on the 
depreciation of the vessel, represented by the entire cost of recovering and repairing it  [13]. Thus, it 
cannot make any difference when that cost was incurred  [13]. Service of a notice of abandonment is 
thus irrelevant  [14-18].  
 
Applying this approach, “ the cost of repairing the  damage” included all the reasonable costs of salving 
and safeguarding the  Renos  from the time of the casualty onwards, together with t he prospective cost 
of repairing her. Th ese costs were  not reduced by being incurred before the notice of abandonment 
and are therefore to be taken into account for the purposes of section 60(2)(ii) of the Act.  [19]    
 
Issue (2): SCOPIC charges  
 
The SCOP IC clause is supplementary to the Lloyds Open Form . The law on salvage was modified by 
the International Salvage Conventi on 1989  (“the Convention”)  [21]. Article 8(1)(b) provide s that in 
performing salvage services, a salvor had a duty to “exercise due car e to prevent or minimise damage 
to the environment”  [21]. Article 14(1) entitles the salvors to “special compensation” fr om the 
shipowner amounting  to the expenses from performing the article 8(1)(b)  duty [21].  
 
Clauses 5 and 6 are the critical parts of t he SCOPIC clause. Clause 5 provides for the assessment of 
the salvor’s remuneration for the totality of the services prov ided, including for environmental  
protection [22]. Clause 6 reflects the fact that such remuneration is intended to avoid environmental  
damage which would be liability of the shipowner [22]. 
 
It is well settled  that “the cost of repairing the damage” in section 60 (2)(ii) include s some costs not 
spent  directly  on actual reinstatement [24]. The common feature of all the cases in which  the c ost of 
preliminary steps have been included is that their objective purpose was to enable the ship to be 
repaired  [25]. That will generally be true of salvage charges , the cost of temporary repairs, towage and 
other steps plainly preliminary to permanent r epair [25]. However, t he objective purpose of SCOPIC 
charges is different. They protect an entirely distinct interest of  the shipowner, namely potential 
liability for environmental pollution  [25]. It is irrelevant that a prudent uninsured owner might 
contr act with the same contractors for both  purposes [25-26]. 
 
It follows that the courts below erred in holdin g that SCOPIC charges are part of the “cost of 
repairing the damage” in section 60(2)(ii) of the Act . [27-28]

gives the judgment of the court.    
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The 1996 Order requires the authority to take into account all sources of income, including all social 
security benefits. There is nothing in it to require or justify the exclusion of non -housi ng benefits of 
any kind. It also requires consideration of  the applicant’s “reasonable living expenses”, which 
necessitates  an objective assessment , not simply the subjective view of the case officer [34].  
 
Even if the recommendation in paragraph 17.40 of  the Code in respect of income support is not 
interpreted as extending to benefits for children, the lack of a specific reference does not make the 
level of those benefits irrelevant. Benefit levels are not generally designed to provide a surplus above 
subsistence needs for the family. If comparison with relevant benefit levels is material to the 
assessment of the applicant, it should not be any less material in assessing what is reasonable by way of 
living expenses in relation to other members of the house hold. The duty to promote and safeguard the 
welfare of children under the Children Act 1989 is also relevant [35].  
 
As one would expect, the guidance makes clear that the amount of an applicable benefit will vary 
“according to the circumstances and compos ition of the applicant’s household”. It also refers to the 
“current tariff…in respect of such benefits” (plural), implying that the tariff may be looked at in 
respect of benefits other than income support, and is at least a good starting point for assessin g 
reasonable living expenses [35].  
 
The review officer in Ms Samuel’s case asked whether there was sufficient “flexibility” to enable her to 
cope with the shortfall between her rent and her housing benefit. But the question ought to have been 
what her rea sonable living expenses were  (other than rent), to be determined having regard to both her 
needs and those of the children. The total expenses  shown in the schedule provided by her solicitors 
(£1,234.99) was well within the amount regarded as appropriate b y way of welfare benefits (£1,349.33). 
It is difficult to see by what standard those  expenses could be regarded as unreasonable [36].  
 
The appeal is therefore allowed, and the review decision quashed. In light of the information available 
to the Court, Lord Carnwath finds it  hard to see on what basis the finding of intentional homelessness 
could be properly upheld. He therefore hope s that on reconsideration the council will be able to accept 
full responsibility under Part VII of the 1996 Act for Ms Samuels  and her family [37].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal , but  for reasons  different from those of the 
Court of Appeal . Lord Sumption gives the lead judgment , with which all members of the Court agree.    The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The law distinguishes between defamation a ctionable per se , which includes all libels and now two 
(previously four) special types of slander, and defamation actionable only on proof of special damage , 
which covers all other slanders [4-5]. Pecuniary loss must be established for the latter category  [5]. 
Before the 2013 Ac t, two decisions ( Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc  [2005] QB 946  (CA) and 
Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Ltd  [2011] 1 WLR 1985  (QB)) introduced the requirement that damage 
to reputation in defamation actionable per se must pas s a minimum threshold of seriousness [7-9]. 
 
This Court considers that  section 1 of the 2013 Act not only raises the threshold of seriousness from 
that in Jameel and Thornton , but requires its application to be determined by reference to the actual facts 
about its impact , not merely  the meaning of the words  [12]. The reasons are as follows:  
 
First, the 2013 Act undoubtedly amends t he common law to some degree , so the least that section 1 
achieved was to introduce a new threshold of serious harm which did no t previously exist . If “serious 
harm ” within the meaning of section 1(1)  can be demonstrated only by reference to the inherent 
tendency of the words, no substantial change  in the law would have  been achieved . However, it is clear 
that section 1 was intende d to make the significant amendment that the extent of damage is now part 
of the test for a defamatory statement. [13, 16] 
 
Secondly, section 1 necessarily means that a statement which would previously have been regarded as 
defamatory , given  its inherent t endency, is no  longer actionable  unless it “has caused or is likely to 
cause” harm which is “serious”. The words “has caused” refer to the consequences of the publication , 
specifically  historic harm. This is a fact ual matter  which must  be established by re ference to the impact 
of the statement. It depends on a combination of the inherent tendency of the words and their actual 
impact on the recipients . The words “likely” to be caused  naturally refer to probable future harm. If 
past harm may be established as  a fact, Parliament must have assumed that future harm could  too. [14] 
 
Thirdly, section 1(1)  must be read  with section 1(2). Section 1(2) deals with how section 1(1) is to be 
applied to defamatory statements  in relation to  a body trading for profit. It adopts the  “serious harm”  
requirement , but provides that for such  a body the statement  must have caused or be likely to cause 
“serious financial loss”.  Thus, for trading bodies, t he “financial loss ” in section 1(2)  is the measure of 
the “harm ” referred to in  section 1(1) , not special damage as understood in the law of defamation . It 
must exceed the pre-2013 Act threshold of seriousness.  This requires an actual impact analysis. [15] 
 
Lord Sumption does not accept that this interpretation of section 1 leads to any major inconsistency 
with section 8 (on limitation) or section 14 (on slanders actionable per se). [17-19] 
 
On the facts, the Supreme Court largely adopts Warby J’s legal approach . It finds no error  in his 
“serious harm” finding  [20]. The finding was pr operly based on a combination of the meaning of the 
words, Mr Lachaux ’s situation , the circumstances of publication and the inherent probabilities  [21].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . It holds that a true construction of condition 4 
does include a member of the armed forces shooting a person he susp ected of bein g a member of the 
IRA and it rejects the procedural challenges advanced by the appellant . Lord Kerr writes the judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
The b readth of the power under section 1 of the Act is immediately apparent. The DPP need only 
suspect  that one of the stipulated conditions is met and that there is a risk that the administration of 
justice might be impaired if there was a jury trial. These decisions  can be of the instinctual, 
impressionistic kind. Whilst the DPP must be able to po int to reasons for his decision, it may be based 
on unverified intelligence or suspicions, or on general experience , rather than on hard evidence  [13].  
 
The circumstances covered by condition 4 are also extremely wide. This covers offences committed to 
any extent  (even if indirectly) in connection with or in response to religious or political hostility  of one 
person or group of persons. The PIRA campaign in Northern Ireland was based on that organisation’s 
political hostility to continuing British rule  and the incident which occurred a few days before Mr 
Cunningham was killed bore all the hallmarks of a PIRA operation. When this is considered, it is 
entirely unsurprising that the DPP should have concluded that the offences with which the appellant  is 
charge d were connected (directly or indirectly) with or in response to the political hostility of PIRA 
members against those who believe that Northern Ireland should remain a part of the UK [14].  
 
The “other exceptional circumstance s” referred to in section 7 (1)(c) of the Act are not specified , but 
they must take their flavour from the preceding provisions and the succeeding words which 
particularise “lack of jurisdiction and error of law” . These are clear indications that the full panoply of 
judicial review sup erintendence is generally not available to challenge  decisions under section 1  [16]. 
 
There  is no need to consider the Explanatory Notes to the Act or the ministerial statements referred to 
by the appellant because the language of the relevant statutory pr ovisions is clear [20] & [24].  
 
Trial by jury should not be assumed to be the unique means of achieving fairness in the criminal 
process. Trial by jury can in certain circumstances be antithetical to a fair trial and the only assured 
means , where those ci rcumstances obtain , of ensuring that the trial is fair is that it be conducted by a 
judge sitting without a jury. [34]. Further, a lthough trial by jury has been referred to as a right, it is not 
an absolute right. Moreover , the right has been restricted by the express provisions of the Act and  
must yield to the need to ensure that a trial is fair [37].  
 
Although it has been argued that the DPP erred in stating that section 1(1) should be broadly 
interpreted, this is irrelevant so long as  (a) he acted within  his powers and (b) any misapprehension was 
immaterial to the decision he took. On the facts of this case, it is clear that the DPP  was bound to 
have made the decision even if he had considered that section 1 had to be construed narrowly [44]. As 
to whethe r he acted within his powers, the DPP took proper steps to allow him to consider whether 
he suspected that condition 4 was met [47]. He also addressed whether there was a risk that the 
administration of justice would be impaired and his conclusion  was enti rely unsurprising [48].  
 
As to the procedural argument, section 7 expressly provides that a judicial review challenge is only 
admissible on grounds of bad faith, dishonesty, or other exceptional circumstances. This is not a case 
of bad faith or dishonesty  [54]. Whilst t he appellant  claims that this case falls into the “exceptional 
circumstances” category because of the fundamental right to a jury trial, the fundamental right is to a 
fair trial . Whilst there is a right to a jury trial , this cannot make this  case an exceptional one, particularly 
in the context of a statute whose purpose is to prescribe the circumstances in which someone can be 
denied the right to a jury trial [55]. There are no circumstances in this case which could be said to be 
exceptional within the terms of section 7(1)(c) of the Act  [62].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The claimants’ particulars of claim do not disclose  any recognisable basis for a cause of action . The case 
should not  proceed to trial.  
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliame nt Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
The claimants focus on section 17 and 47 of the 1989  Act, but it is accepted that the Act does not create  
a statutory cause of action. Therefore, the question is whether local authorities may be liable for  breach 
of a common law duty of care in relation to the performance of their functions under the Act. [25] 
 
Public authorities do not owe a duty of care at common law merely because they have statutory powers 
or duties, even if, by exercising their statutory functions,  they could prevent a person from suffering 
harm . However, they can come under a common law duty to protect someone from harm in 
circumstances where the principles applicable to private individuals or bodies would also impose such a 
duty, as for example wh ere the authority has created the source of danger or assumed a responsibility to 
protect the claimant from harm, unless the imposition of such a duty would be inconsistent with the 
relevant legislation. [65] 
  
The present case is not one where the council  is alleged to have harmed the claimants, but one in which 
the council is alleged to have failed to provide a benefit to the claimants by protecting them from harm. 
[74] The claimants’ case is that the council had assumed a responsibility towards them to t ake reasonable 
care in investigating and monitoring their position. If such care had been taken, the council would have 
exercised its powers under the 1989 Act to remove the claimants from their home into at least temporary  
care. The council ’s conduct in  investigati ng and monitoring the claimants’ position did not , however,  
involve the provision of a service to them on which they or their mother could be expected to rely. It 
could not be said that the claimants and their mother had entrusted their safety to the council , or that 
the council  had accepted that responsibility. Nor had the council taken the claimants into its care, and 
thereby assumed responsibility for their welfare.  The council therefore did not assume a responsibility 
towards them.  [80]-[81] 
 
The claimants a lso advance an alternative  claim on the basis that the council is vicariously liable for 
negligence by the social workers in its employ ment . There is no doubt that, in carrying out the council’s 
statutory functions, the social workers were under a contractual duty to the council to exercise proper 
professional skill and care. The question is whether, in addition, they also owed a similar duty t o the 
claimants under the law of tort. That depends on whether the social workers assumed a responsibility 
towards the claimants to perform their functions with reasonable care. [86] A defendant may assume 
responsibility to a claimant where he undertakes t he performance of some task or the provision of some 
service for the claimant with an  undertaking that reasonable care will be taken . Such an  undertaking may 
be express but is  more commonly implied, usually by reason of the foreseeability of reliance by the 
claimant on the exercise of such care. [88] In the circumstances of this case, however, the particulars of 
claim do not set out any basis on which such an assumption of responsibility might be established at 
trial. [89] 
 
Any uncertainty as to whether this case is one which can properly be struck out is eliminated by the 
further difficulties that arise in relation to the claimant’s case  that the council breached its duty of care 
by failing to remove the  claimants  from the ir home into, at least, temporary care. In order  to obtain a 
care order under the relevant provisions , it would have been necessary to establish that the claimant s 
were suffering, or were likely to suffer, significant harm which was attributable to a lack, o r likely lack, 
of reasonable parental care. The harm suffered by the claimants was attributable to the conduct of the 
neighbouring family , rather than a lack of reasonable parental care . There were simply no grounds for 
removing the children from their mother. [90]

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal. Lady Arden , with whom the rest of the Court 
agrees, delivers the judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
It was common ground that, if the conversion at Stage 3 involved separate conversions of the QCBs 
and the non -QCBs, the appeal must fail. The question whether there was a single conversion,  or two 
separate conversions , must be a q uestion of applying the provisions of TCGA to the facts. The answer 
is not mandated in the appellants’ favour by the fact that they utilised a single transaction  [19]. 
 
Plainly, section 116(1)(b) contemplates the possibility of a single transaction which i nvolves a pre -
conversion holding of both QCBs and non -QCBs, and this, coupled with the fact that the Court of 
Appeal’s interpretation renders the words “or include” appearing in section 116(1)(b) otiose are 
powerful arguments in support of the appellants’ construction  [20]. However, the appellants’ 
interpretation would be inexplicable in terms of the policy expressed in these provisions, which is to 
enable all relevant reorganisations to benefit from the same rollover relief. Taxpayers could avoid th ose 
provisions with extreme ease if the appellants are right [21]. 
 
By looking to the fiscal policy behind the scheme, the Court of Appeal  applied a purposive approach  
[22]. The Court of Appeal did not give any meaning to the words “or include” in section 116(1)( b), 
but this is appropriate because in section 132(3), as the Upper Tribunal pointed out, it is clear that the 
intention of Parliament was that each security converted into a QCB should be viewed as a separate 
conversion . Moreover, it is not an objection t hat section 127 contemplates a single asset because 
Parliament has required sections 127 to 131 to be applied with “necessary adaptations”. In those 
circumstances the clear words principle is observed in the present case  [23]. 
 
There are cases where to ach ieve Parliament’s obvious intention a strained interpretation  may need to 
be taken in place of one which would be contrary to the clear intention of Parliament. This principle 
can apply even to a tax statute. However, the c ircumstances in which such an app roach  can be applied 
must be limited, for example, to those where there is not simply some inconsistency with evident 
Parliamentary intention but some clear contradiction with it. Moreover, the intention of Parliament 
must be clearly found on the wording o f the legislation [24]. Nothing in Lady Arden’s judgment 
detracts from t hat principle , but it is unnecessary to consider its application to this case because  the 
construction of the relevant provisions is clear without resort to it [26]. 
 
Lady Arden conclu ded that, i n summary, on the true interpretation of TCGA section 116(1)(b), the 
potential gain within the non -QCBs was frozen on conversion and did not  (to use Lewison LJ’s words)  
disappear in a puff of smoke  [27].

The Supreme Court allows  the appeal  by a majority  of three to two . Lord Carnwath gives the judgment  
of the majority , with which Lord Reed and Lord Lloyd -Jones agree . Lord Briggs gives a di ssenting 
judgment, with which Lady Black agrees.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Carnwath  notes that the court must take the Joint  Position Paper as it stands. It cannot look 
beyond it to evidence which was not referred to by the tribunal, nor attempt to r esolve issues which 
were left unresolved by agreement. However, in so far as there are differences as to its interpretation, 
the court is entitled to look at the context in which it was arrived at, and the state of the evidence as 
recorded by the tribunal at that time [31]. 
 
He approves of the Upper Tribunal’s reliance on London County Council v Church Wardens and Overseers of 
the Poor of the Parish of Erith in the County of Kent [1893] AC 562, from which it extracted the proposition 
that “the true test is whether the occupation is of value”, contrasted with land that was “struck with 
sterility in any and everybody’s hands [36-42]. Cases such as Hoare v National Trust [1998] RA 391 and 
Tomlinson v Plymouth Argyle Football Co Ltd (1960) 31 DRA 788, referred t o by the Court of Appeal, do 
not assist the respondent as in those cases the absence of alternative tenants was due to the inherently 
burdensome nature of the properties , rather than the state of the market  [46-48]. 
 
Lord Carnwath  endorses the distinction drawn in previous Land Tribunal cases between a property 
which is unoccupied merely because of a surplus between supply and demand in the market, and a 
property which has “reached the end of its economic life” [55]. The Valuation Office Agency’s 
guidance o n whether a property is obsolete lists several  relevant considerations, including whether the 
property was occupied at the antecedent valuation date, and whether there are other similar properties 
in the locality that are occupied [56]. This highlights the  issues of fact which may become relevant in 
drawing the distinction in particular cases, but which , by agreement,  the tribunal in the present case 
was not required to resolve [57]. 
 
Whether the building is occupied or unoccupied, or an actual tenant has b een identified, at the relevant 
date is not critical. Even in a “saturated” market the rating hypothesis assumes a willing tenant, and by 
implication one who is sufficiently interested to enter  negotiations to agree a rent on the statutory 
basis. There is no reason why, in the absence of other material evidence, the level of that rent should 
not be assessed by reference to “general demand” derived from “occupation of other office properties 
with similar characteristics” [58]. The majority therefore allows t he appeal and restores the decision of 
the Upper Tribunal [61]. 
 
Lord Briggs , dissenting,  comes to a different conclusion about the meaning and consequences of the 
Joint Position Paper . In the real world the existence of comparable properties at substantia l rents 
would ordinarily have compelled an examination of whether one or more of the tenants in those 
properties would have been prepared to relocate to the subject property at a lower, but still more than 
nominal, rent  [62]. It will be very rare that the evidence really does show that there is no demand at all 
for the subject property where there are comparable properties in the locality let at substantial rents. 
But if that is what the evidence shows (or what the parties have agreed), the rating hypothesi s does not 
require a departure from that real -world conclusion, merely because the subject property is in theory 
capable of beneficial occupation [83].

agrees) and Lord Wilson give dissenting judgments.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
(i) Whether section 67( 8) of RIPA ousts the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court  
 
Lord Carnwath holds that the interpretation of section 67(8) must be informed by the close parallel 
with the provision under review by the House of Lords in Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission 
[1969] 2 AC 14 . By the time the predecessor to  RIPA was drafted in 1985, following Lord Diplock’s 
explanation in O’Reilly v Mackman [1983 ] 2 AC 237 , the drafter can have had no doubt that a 
determination vitiated  by any error of law, jurisdictional or not, was to be treated as no determination 
at all . The reference to a determination was to be read as a reference only to a legally valid 
determination  [105] .  
 
The exercise is not one of ordinary statutory interpret ation, as there is a common law presumption 
against oust ing the jurisdiction of the High Court . The plain words of the subsection must yield to the 
principle that such a clause will not protect a decision that is legally invalid . Therefore the exclusion in 
section 67(8) of RIPA applies only to determinations, awards or other decisions that are not erroneous 
in law  [107] . 
 
The relevant decision in this case raised a short point of law, which on n o ordinary view could be 
regarded a s a “decision as to whether [the IPT] had jurisdiction”  [108] . If read in the context  of 
Anisminic , those words in parenthesis in section 67(8) apply only to a legally valid decision relating to 
jurisdiction [109] . This does not mean the words in parenthes is are otiose , as some decisions as to 
jurisdiction will involve issues of fact to which the exclusion could be said to apply without engaging 
the presumption against ouster [110] .  
 
Moreover , judicial review can only be excluded by the most clear and explicit words . A more explicit 
formula might have excluded challenges to any determination or “purported ” determination  [111] . The 
features of the IPT regime, on which the Court of Appeal relied, do not change the interpretation of 
section  67(8) . As this case shows, the IPT can organise its procedures to ensure that a material point of 
law can be considered without threatening any security interests . Further , the potential for overlap  with 
legal issues considered by ordinary courts makes it important that the IPT  is not able to develop its 
own “local” law without scope for further review  [112] . 
 
Lord Lloyd -Jones  agrees with Lord Carnwath. He adds that it is a necessary corollary of the 
sovereignty of Parliament that there should exist an authoritative and independent body which can 
interpret and mediate legislation made by Parliament . Central to the appeal is whether it was the 
intention of Parliament to  modify the procedures by which statute law is mediated  [160] . He finds it  a 
striking feature of section 67(8) and its predecessor that it failed to exclude purported determinations, 
awards and other decisions, in light of the judgment of Lord Diplock in O’Reilly v Mackman  [164] . The 
words  in parenthesis do not extend the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the High Court to what purport 
to be decisions but in law are not to be so regarded [165] .  
 
Lord Sumption, dissenting,  concludes that the effect of section 67(8) is to exclude the jurisdiction of 
the High Court to entertain a challenge to the IPT’s decisions on the merits . The rule of law is 
sufficiently vindicated by the judicial character of the IPT and it does not require a right of appeal 
from the decisions of a judicial body of this kind  [172] . If the IPT’s construction  of section 5(2) of the 
1994 Act was an error, then it was an error within the permitted field of interpretive power which 
Parliament has conferred on the IPT. Therefore , the effect of section 67(8) is that the High Court  had 
no jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to the IPT’s decision in the present case  [206] . 
 
Lord Wilson, dissenting, concludes that the m eaning of the words in pare nthesis in section 67(8) 
encompass within the exclusion of judicial supervision all the decisions of the IPT in relation to its 
“jurisdiction” . He ascribe s to that word the strained extension of its effect adopted in Anisminic , such The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 that the exclusion in section 67(8)  cover s both  ordinary errors  of law as well as errors  of jurisdiction  in 
the proper sense of the word . The presumption that Parliament did not intend such an exclusion has 
to yield to the only reasonable meaning of its words [224] .  
 
 
(ii) Whether Parliament may by  statute oust the supervisory  jurisdiction  of the High Court  
 
Lord Carnwath states that his conclusion on the first issue makes it str ictly unnecessary to consider the 
second issue  [113] . He nonetheless comments that it is ultimately for the courts, not the legislature, to 
determine the limits set by the rule of law to the power to exclude review [131] . This proposition is a 
natural application of the constitutional principle of the rule of law and an essential counterpart to the 
power of Parliament to make law . The question in any case is the level of scrutiny required by the rule 
of law [132] . Some forms of ouster clause may readily  satisfy such a test, as in the six-week time  limit 
for planning cases [133] . Lord Carnwath sees a strong case for holding tha t binding effect cannot be 
given to a clause which purports wholly to exclude the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court to 
review a decision of an inferior court or tribunal, whether for excess or abuse of jurisdiction, or error 
of law . It should remain a matter for the court to determine the extent to which such a clause should 
be upheld, having regard to its purpose and statut ory context, and the nature and importance of the 
legal issue in question [144] . 
 
Lord Sumption  does not think it would be appropriate or wise to answer the second issue in wholly 
general terms. It should be addressed in the context of the statute  in this case, and of the assumption 
that section 67(8) excludes judicial review of the IPT’s  decisions on merits [207] . He accepts that 
Parliament’s intention that there should be legal limits to a tribunal’s  jurisdiction is not consistent with 
the courts lacking the capacity to enforce those  limits [210] . The question here, however, is how to 
reconcile the limited character of the IPT’s jurisdiction with the language of section 67(8).  The 
reconciliation is th at section 67(8) does no more than exclude review by the High Court  of the merits 
of decisions made by a tribunal performing the same functions as the High Court . It is in substance an 
exclusion of appeals on the merits and other proceedings tantamount to an appeal on the merits  [211] . 
 
Lord Wilson recast s the second issue to address only Parliament’s exclusion of judicial review of an 
ordinary error of law  [237] . He concludes that P arliament has conferred both independence and 
authority upon the IPT and , in those circumstances , Parliament does have the power to exclude 
judicial review of any ordinary errors of law made by it  [252-253].

The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal by a majority of 5-2. Lord Wilson (with whom Lord Hodge

Lord Hodge (with whom Lord Hughes agrees) give concurring judgments. Lady Hale agrees with Lord 
Wilson on the principle s, but not the outcome. Lord Kerr disagrees with him about both.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Lord Wilson acknowledges that the cap has had a major impact on lone parent households with a child 
aged under five and in particular under two [22]. It does incentivise them to try to find work for at 
least 16 hours per week, but this was argued to fly in the face of the government’s own policy of 
providing no free childcare for children under two and of replacing income support with job -seeker’s 
allowance onl y after a lone parent’s youngest child has reached school age. The government’s funding 
of Discretionary Housing Payments (‘DHPs’) may alleviate the impact of the cap on such lone parent The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 households but the evidence on this could be stronger. The cap saves little public money, but it can 
take the families it affects well below the poverty line. Living in poverty has a particularly adverse 
impact on the development of children under five [23]-[34].  
 
The cap’s reduction of benefits to well below the poverty l ine engages the claimant mothers’ and 
children’s right under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights  (‘ECHR’) to respect 
for their family life [35]-[37]. Each of the four classes of claimants has a separate status under Article 
14 (for example , ‘lone parents of children under two’) on grounds of which status, they might 
complain they face discrimination in the enjoyment of that right [38]-[39]. Their complaint, for which 
there is prima facie evidence, would be that despite being in a relevantly  different situation from others 
subjected to the cap, they are treated the same way – see Thlimmenos v Greece  (2000) 31 EHRR 12  [40]-
[51]. 
 
The government must objectively justify this discrimination – in this case, its failure to exempt the DA 
and DS cohorts from the cap [52]-[54]. The test for whether the government can justify a 
discriminatory rule governing the distribution of welfare benefits is whether the rule is manifestly 
without reasonable foundation (‘MWRF’). Once the government has put forward a foundation, the 
court will proactively examine whether it is reasonable [55]-[66]. The United Nations Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (‘UNCRC’) requires the public authorities to treat the child’s best interests as a 
primary consideration. It forms  no part of our domestic law, but aids interpretation of the ECHR, as 
to whether the government unjustifiably discriminated against the children and their parents in their 
enjoyment of their right under Article 8. The evidence shows that the government did , as a primary 
consideration, evaluate the likely impact of the cap on lone parents with young children [67]-[87]. 
Furthermore, the government’s belief that there are better long -term outcomes for children in 
households where an adult works is a reasonable  foundation for treating the DA and DS cohorts 
similarly to all others subjected to the cap [88].  
 
Lord Carnwath and Lord Hodge both express reservations on the issue of status, but agree with Lord 
Wilson on the relevance of the UNCRC and also on the appl ication of the MWRF test. They agree 
with him that the executive and Parliament both gave proper consideration to the interests of the 
children affected [89]-[123] , [124] -[131] . 
 
Lady Hale agrees with Lord Wilson on the legal principles but not their appli cation. She holds that the 
government failed to strike a fair balance between the very limited public benefits of the cap and the 
severe damage done to the family lives of young children and their lone parents if the parents must 
choose between working out side the home and not having enough for the family to live on [132] -
[157] . 
 
Lord Kerr considers  the MWRF test to have derived from the margin of appreciation which is 
afforded to decisions of national authorities in the European Court of Human Rights . He would not  
import this approach  into the national court’s consideration of a measure’s proportionality. The steps 
in the proportionality analysis at the national level are well settled in the case law [164]-[172] . The 
MWRF standard should not be applied as part of  this analysis – instead, the question should be 
whether  the government has established that there is a reasonable foundation for its conclusion that a 
fair balance has been struck [173]-[177].  In relation to t he UNCRC, Lord Kerr does not agree wit h 
Lord Wilson that the key question is whether the government has acted in breach of Article 3 of the 
UNCRC [183]. A finding that Article 3 has not been breached does no t establish the proportionality of 
the measure [186]. The evidence in this case shows t hat, while the impact on children’s rights was 
considered, it was not given a primacy of importance which Article 3 requires  [196].

The Su preme Court dismisses  the appeal . Lord Briggs gives the lead judgment, with which all members 
of the Court agree. The claimants succeed on issues (1), (2) and (4) , though not on issue (3) .  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
(1) Abuse of EU law:  
 
Article 4.1 of the Recast Brussels Regulation confers a right on any claimant  (regardless of their 
domicile)  to sue an English domiciled defendant in England irrespective of connecting factors to other 
jurisdictions [16]. Issue (1)  presupposes that there is a real triable issue against  Vedanta [17, 26] . 
Further, the judge’s  finding  that Vedanta was  sued in England for the genuine purpose of obtaining 
damages, even though attracting English jurisdiction over KCM was a  key contribut ing factor , is not 
open to challenge [27]. Any implied exception to the  effect  of article 4 .1 must be construed narrowly 
[29-30]. The EU case law on abuse  of law  under article 8.1 (related defendants) is equally restrictive 
[31-34]. In that context , the test  is whether the sole purpose of joining a defendant is to sue them  
other than in their Member State of domicile  [35]. The EU case law also suggests that the abuse of law 
doctrine is limited to situations where EU law is invoked  collusively  to subvert other  EU provisions  
[36]. In light of the  decis ion in Owusu v Jackson (C-281/02) [2005] QB 801  (CJEU) , arguments based 
on forum conveniens  cannot justify  derogating from the primary rule of jurisdiction in article 4 .1 [36-40]. 
The concern  about the wide effect of article 4.1 in this case is best addres sed under the domestic law 
on the “necessary or proper party” gateway [40]. The claimants thus succeed on issue (1) [41].         
 
(2) Real triable issue as against Vedanta:  
 
The summary judgment test applies to issue  (2) and it falls to be decided without  cross -examination or 
disclosure of the opposing party’s documents , given the need for proportionality [42-43]. In this case, 
the question what level of managerial intervention by Vedanta in KCM’s operation of the Mine is 
sufficient to attract liability in  negligence is a question for Zambian law, but the question  what that 
level actually was is a pure question of fact [44]. The assertion that the negligence claim against 
Vedanta raises a novel and controversial legal issue is misplaced, as the liability of  parent companies in 
relation to the activities of their subsidiaries is not, in itself, a distinct category of negligence unsuit ed 
to summary determination  [49-51, 54] . On the facts, there was sufficient material identified by the 
judge in support of the view that the claimants’ case was arguable  and the judge made no error of law 
in assessing this issue, so his decision on the negligence claim must stand [55-62]. Further, as Zambian 
law requires substantially the same factual inquiry for the breach of sta tutory duty claim, the judge 
properly concluded that this claim was also arguable and, in any event, the point is academic [65].    
 
(3) England as the proper place:  
 
The domestic law ‘proper place ’ test requires a summary examination of connecting factors  to one or 
more potential jurisdictions [66]. The search is for a single jurisdiction in which the claims against all 
defendants may most suitably be tried [68]. Importantly, in cases where it was found that the claim(s) 
against the anchor defendant will be continue d in England, the courts have treated the risk of 
irreconcilable judgments as a decisive factor in favour of England as the proper place for the claim 
against the non -EU defendant as well  [70]. The judge in this case applied th at ap proach [71-72]. That 
was a legal error in circumstances where Vedanta had by the time of the hearing offered to submit to 
the Zambian jurisdiction, so that the whole case could be tried there [75, 79] . While an offer to submit 
does not preclude a claim in England agains t Vedanta alone, it has the effect that a risk of 
irreconcilable judgments would be the result of the claimants’ choice to exercise their article 4 right, 
rather than because Zambia is not an available forum for  all the claims  [75]. Leggatt J’s j udgment in  
OJSC VTB Bank v P arline L td [2013] EWHC 3538 (Comm) is overruled on this point since : (1) article 4 
is not designed to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments; (2) article 8.1 on joinder is limited to the 
intra-EU context and gives claimants  a choice to consolidate proceedings  in order to avoid that risk ; 
and (3) there is no  reason therefore why claimants should not have to make the same choice, merely 
because the foreign defendant is domiciled outside the EU  [79-83]. It does not follow that the risk of  
irreconcilable judgments is not a relevant factor in this case, but it is no longer a trump card such that The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 the judge made an error of principle in regarding it as decisive [84]. Looking at the relevant connecting 
factors in the round, Zambia would plainly  have been the proper place for this litigation  as a whole , 
provided substantial justice was available to the parties in Zambia [85-87]. The risk of irreconcilable 
judgments mainly concerns the claimants, and they have the choice to avoid it by suing all t he 
defendants in Zambia, or to incur it by exercising their right to sue Vedanta in England.   
 
(4) Substantial justice in Zambia:  
 
Even if the court concludes that a foreign jurisdiction is the apparently the proper place , the court may 
still permit servic e of English proceedings on the foreign defendant if  cogent evidence shows that 
there is a real risk that substantial justice would  not be obtainable  in that foreign jurisdiction  [88]. In 
this case, the judge identified “access to justice” issues in Zambia  [89]. It is not in doubt that Zambia 
has independent judges, courts and civil procedure which would ensure a just trial of large 
environmental group claims like this one  [89]. The issues are twofold. First, the practicable 
impossibility of funding such gr oup claims where the claimants are all in extreme poverty , because  they 
could not obtain legal aid and because conditional fee agreements (CFAs) are unlawful in Zambia     
[89-90]. Secondly, the absence within Zambia of sufficiently substantial and suitably  experienced legal 
teams to enable effective litigation of this size and complexity, in particular against a  well-resourced 
opponent like KCM  [89]. The criticisms that the judge failed in his approach to the access to  justice 
issue are not well -founded [92-98]. Overall , the defendants fail on issue (4), which means their success 
on issue (3) is academic [101-102].  
 
Conduct of litigation on jurisdiction:  
 
The court takes the opportunity to warn litigants of the need to conduct jurisdiction disputes in an 
economical and proportionate manner  [6-14].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal as it finds in favour of Mr Derry on t he first 
issue.  The loss relief was correctly deducted from the net income for 2009/10 . Lord Carnwath gives 
the lead judgment, with which Lord Reed, Lady Black and Lord Kitchin agree. Lady Arden gives a 
concurring judgment.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
(1) HMRC’ s appeal: whether the loss relief was correctly deducted from the net income in 2009/10.  
 
Lord Carnwath observes that section 23 and sections 131 -132 of the 2007 Act create a clear and self -
contained code for the treatment of a claim to share -loss relief s uch as that of Mr Derry. Sections 132 -
133 give him an “entitlement” to make the claim, to specify the tax year to which it is to be applied, 
and to do so by deducting it in the calculation of his “net income” for the purpose of section 23 [35].  
 
It would be extraordinary for that entitlement to be taken away, without any direct reference or 
signpost, by a provision in a relatively obscure schedule of another statute ( schedule 1B of the 1970 
Act), which is concerned principally with management of tax, rathe r than with liability . Provisions in 
the 2007 Act which refer to the 1970 Act do not assist . For example, while  sections 60(2) and 128(7) 
of the 2007 Act  refer to schedule 1B of the 1970 Act as a qualification of  the rights otherwise 
conferred by those pro visions, the absence of similar words in section 132 of the 2007 Act indicates 
that this right is not subject to the same qualification  [36]. 
 
The words of schedule 1B of the 1970 Act are not sufficient to displace the clear provisions of the 
2007 Act in r espect of liability. As the governing statute in respect of tax liability, the 2007 Act should 
take precedence in the absence of any indication to the contrary [37]. Any such indications in the 
legislative history or the explanatory notes to the 2007 Act d o not provide a basis for departing from 
the ordinary principles of statutory interpretation. There is no suggestion that they produce an absurd 
or unworkable result, and for the taxpayer’s liability to be determined by reference to legal archaeology 
would  negate the whole purpose of the tax law rewrite [38]. 
 
Lord Carnwath endorses the guidance on interpreting consolidation statutes , such as the 2007 Act, in 
Eclipse Film Partners (No 35) LLP v Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs [2013] UKUT 639 
(TC) at paragraph 56 [9 – 10]. Lady Arden  adds that the courts may look at previous case law on 
consolidated provisions in the interests of the consistency of the law, the fulfilment of Parliament’s 
presumed intention that the law should not be changed , and the efficient use of judicial resources [88].   
 
(2) Mr Derry’s cross -appeal: whether an erroneous claim for loss relief would be part of the 2009/10 tax return.  
 
Lord Carnwath notes that the conclusion on the first issue makes it strictly unnecessary to  reach a 
conclusion on the second issue [40]. Furthermore, he is not satisfied that the issues were fully explored 
in argument before the Supreme Court, which concentrated on the entitlement to relief rather than the 
means of enforcement. There remain unre solved uncertainties as to the correct interpretation of the 
entries in the online form and their treatment by HMRC , and the relationship between enquiries under 
section 9A (into a return) and Schedule 1A paragraph 5 (into a claim outside a return) of the 1970 Act  
[68]. 
 
In a separate judgment, Lady Arden expresses the provisional view, in light of the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs v Cotter  [2013] 1 WLR 1514, the provisions 
of the legislation, the prescribed  online tax return form and the evidence of Mr Graham Dean on 
behalf of HMRC, that the erroneous entry of a loss relief claim, which a tax payer was not entitled to 
make in that year’s return, does not form part of the tax return for enquiry purposes. On t hat basis, 
HMRC would be right to open an enquiry into the claim and not the return [73 – 83].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Sales gives the lead judgment, with which 
all members of the Court agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The prop er interpretation of point 1.14 requires a correct application of the guidance provided in the 
CJEU judgment  [51]. In its preliminary ruling, t he CJEU identified three cumulative criteria in defining 
MSM  for the purposes of point 1.14 : (1) the use of bones  from which the intact muscles have already 
been detached, or of poultry carcases, to which meat remains attached ; (2) the use of methods of 
mechanical separation to recover that meat ; and ( 3) the loss or modification of the muscle fibre 
structure of the m eat recovered through  the use of those processes  [26]. The CJEU added that any 
meat product which satisfies those three criteria must be classified as  MSM , irrespective of the degree 
of loss or modification of the muscle fibre structure, provided  the loss or modification is greater than  
that wh ich is  strictly confined to the cutting point  (“the cutting point qualification”)  [26]. 
 
In the Supreme Court, it was common ground between the parties that Newby’s pork and chicken  
products  meet the first two criteri a for categorisation of MSM within  point 1.14 [52]. The appeal th us 
turns on whether Newby’s  products meet  criterion  (3), in light of the “cutting point qualification ” [52]. 
As identified in the courts below, t here are two main  possible readings of what the CJEU  meant by 
“cutting point” : (1) on a narrower reading, it refers to the cutting of intact muscles , or (2) on a more 
expansive reading, it refers to the points at which the meat has been severed or separated during the 
process of recovering it  [39]. Edwards -Stuart J favoured the more expansive reading [42-43], while the 
Court of Appeal preferred the narrower reading [45-46]. This Court finds that , on the proper 
interpretation of the CJEU judgment , the narrower reading  is correct [51]. 
 
First, the way in  which the CJEU formulated criterion (1) reflects the words “removing meat from 
flesh-bearing bones after boning or from poultry carcases”  in point 1.14 [54]. The CJEU’s formulation 
speaks of meat remaining attached to poultry carcases, rather than simply referring to poultry carcases, 
which would include all (not merely some of) the meat on the carcase  [55].  
 
Secondly, the CJEU clearly held that  the concept of  MSM does not depend on it being shown  that the 
process referred to in point 1.14 “results in a l oss or modification of the muscle fibre structure which 
is significant” , rejecting outright Newby’s case [56]. On the CJEU’s approach, the dividing line is 
much clearer. M eat removed from a carcase will not be MSM if it is removed by mechanical means in 
the first phase of cutting meat from the whole carcase, but will generally be MSM if it is later removed 
by mechanical means [57]. This clear distinction avoid s the need for m icroscopic investigation [57]. 
 
Thirdly, the legal analysis is not affected by evid ence (1)  that chicken carcases will  occasionally  be 
subjected to Newby’s process without the breasts first being removed  or (2) that the wishbone is 
usually cut out of the breast meat before mechanical removal  of whole chicken breasts  [61-63].  
 
Lastly and  importantly, the CJEU judgment made it explicit that , applying the definition in point 1.14 , 
Newby’s products fall to be categorised as  MSM  [66]. The CJEU was entitled to express its view on 
the application of point 1.14 to this case and there is nothing to call into question its analysis [69-75]. 
After the CJEU judgment, the position is acte clair and no further reference to the CJEU is needed [76]. 
 
The Court reaches the above conclusions having seen, but not relied on, further evidence submitted by 
three of the  four interveners  [49-50]. The Court refuses permission to admit this further evidence due 
to unfairness to the FSA and, in any event, th is evidence is not consider ed to affect the outcome [50].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows Mrs Stocker’s  appeal. It holds that Mitting J erred in law by 
using dictionary definitions as the starting point of his analysis of meaning and in subse quently failing 
properly to take into account the context of the Facebook post.  Lord Kerr writes the judgment, with 
which all members of the Court agree.   The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Squar e London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Mitting  J’s approach produces an obviously anomalous result in that the ph rase “he strangled me”  on his 
analysis entail s a less serious accusation than the phrase “he tried to strangle me” . This is the consequence 
of confining the meaning of the words exclusively to two dictionary definitions [16 – 17]. 
 
Contrary to the view of the Court of Appeal, Mitting J was not using the dictionary definitions as a 
check. He referred to these before hearing any argument about meaning and did not use  the word 
“check”  in his judgment or in his exchanges with the lawyers in the case. Instead , Mitting  J regarded 
these definitions as the only possible meanings which he could consider or, at the very least, as the 
starting point for his analysis [23 – 24].  
 
Where a statement has more than one plausible meaning, the question of whether defamation h as 
occurred can only be answered by deciding which  single meaning should be given to the statement 
[34].  
 
The primary role of the court is to focus on how the ordinary reasonable reader would construe the 
words. To fulfil this obl igation, the court should  be particularly conscious of the context in which a 
statement is made [38]. The hypothetical reader should be considered to be a person who would read 
the publication [39].  
 
The fact that this was a Facebook post is critical and it was necessary for the judge to keep in mind the 
way in which such postings are made and read [41]. It is unwise to search a Facebook post for its 
theoretical or logically deducible meaning. The search for meaning should reflect that this is a casual 
medium in the nature of a co nversation rather than a carefully chosen expression [43]. People scroll 
through Facebook quickly and their reaction to posts is impressionistic and fleeting [44].  
 
Through relying on the dictionary definitions, Mitting J fell into legal error. As a conse quence of this, 
he failed to conduct a realistic exploration of how an ordinary reader of the Facebook post would have 
understood it [47]. As a result of this error of law, the decision on meaning cannot stand and it is 
appropriate for the Supreme Court to  determine the meaning of the post itself [48].  
 
An ordinary reader of the post would have interpreted the post as meaning that Mr Stocker had 
grasped Mrs Stocker by the throat and applied force to her neck [49]. 
 
In light of this, the defence of justific ation should succeed. E ven if Mrs Stocker’s allegations were 
considered not to have been established to the letter, there is more than enough to demonstrate that 
that defence should not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge was not proved  [61].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Having regard to the statutory requirements and the terms of the certificate , which disclose the 
insurer’s intention , the policy must be construed so that the third party cover  meets the requirements 
of the RTA [24]. As the certificate did not purport to provide any additional cover in itself, and 
because the relevant legislation treats a certificate of insurance as distinct from a policy, it is  therefore  
necessary to read words  into clause 1 a.  H owever , the CA went too far by doing so in such a way as to 
extend cover  to any accident involving Mr Holden's vehicle  [25-31]. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
The first step is to ask what “caused by, or arising out of , the use of the vehicle  on a road or other publi c place ” 
means.  In English case law, the statutory word “use” has been interpreted broadly to cover any 
situation where the owner has an element of control, management or operation of the vehicle on the 
road or in a public  place . The reason is that even a parked car may be a hazard on a road or in such a 
place  [32-34]. The words “caused by, or arising out of the use of”  further extend the required cover, but 
there must be a reasonable limit to the causal chain  [42-45].  
 
The concept of “use” in EU law goes further, and is not confined to a road or other public place. It 
extends to any use of a vehicle as a means of transport. To comply with EU law,  Parliament may need 
to reconsider the wording of the RTA . But the RTA  cannot be “read down ” to comply by excisi ng the 
words “on a road or other public place ” because this would go against the grain and thrust of the legislation. 
It is therefore the cover required by the RTA, not EU law, that must be read into the policy  [35-41]. 
 
Where the context and background of  a contract drives the courts to the conclusion that something 
has gone wrong with the language used, it may adopt a corrective construction where it is clear what a 
reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant [46-47]. 
 
Here, the nece ssary correction is to extend the cover beyond what was expressly provided to that 
which the RTA requires, and no more [48-49]. 
 
The CA erred in not adopting this approach : the formulation “involving your vehicle ” expand ed the cover 
significantly beyond bo th the express terms of the clause  and the requirements of the RTA , by 
removing the statutory causal link between use of the vehicle on a road or other public place and the 
accident  [50]. 
 
Nor does the statutory rule that the interpretation most favo urable  to the consumer must prevail apply  
to a situation such as this , where the court is correcting a mistake in the language used and there is no 
doubt about the parties ’ intended meaning [51]. The appropriate corrective construction is therefore to 
read the clause  as if it said “we will cover you for your legal responsibility if you have an accident in your vehicle or if 
there is an accident caused by or arising out of your use of your vehicle on a road or other public place  and…” [52]. 
 
Mr Holden's accident d oes not fall within clause 1a as so interpreted. A vehicle being repaired on 
private property is not being “used” [53]. 
 
Furthermore, although the attempted repairs  may have arisen out of the use of the car, the property 
damage did not. It was Mr Holden's alleged negligence in carrying out the repairs, not the prior use of 
the car as a means of transport, that caused the relevant damage [54-55].

The Supreme Court  unanimously dismisses  the appeal . Lord Hodge  gives the sole judgment with 
which the other Justices agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
Since the enactment of the 1623 Statute of Monopolies, the purpose of a grant of a patent has been to 
encourage innovation. The “patent bargain”  is this: the inventor obtains a monopoly in return for 
disclosing the invention and dedicating it to the public for use after the monopoly has expired  [53]. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 This overarching principle has survived the amendment of UK patent law after accession to the 
Euro pean Patent Convention  [54]. 
 
In addressing the statutory question of obviousness in section 3 of the 1977 Act it is common for 
English courts to adopt the so -called Windsurfing/Pozzoli  structure [60]. An alternative approach which 
the EPO often adopts is the so called “problem -and-solution approach”  [61]. While both approaches 
focus on the inventive concept put forward in the claims, neither approach should be applied in a 
mechanistic way  [62]. The question of obviousness must be considered on the facts of each case [63]. 
 
Factors which are relevant considerations in the present case include the following  [64]. First, it is 
relevant to consider whether at the priority date something was “obvious  to try”, in other words 
whether it was obvious to undertake a specific piece of research which had a reasonable or fair 
prospect of success  [65]. Secondly, it follows that the routine nature of the research and any 
established practice of following such r esearch through to a particular point may be a relevant 
consideration [66]. Thirdly, the burden and cost of the research programme is relevant  [67]. Fourthly, 
the necessity for and the nature of the value judgments which the skilled team would have in the 
course of a testing programme are relevant considerations  [68]. Fifthly, the existence of alternative or 
multiple paths of research will often be an indicator that the invention contained in the claim or claims 
was not obvious  [69]. Sixthly, the motive of the skilled person is a relevant consideration. The notional 
skilled person is not assumed to undertake technical trials for the sake of doing so but rather because 
he or she has some end in mind  [70]. Seventhly, the fact that the results of research which  the inventor 
actually carried out are unexpected or surprising is a relevant consideration as it may point to an 
inventive step  [71]. Eighthly, the courts have repeatedly emphasised that one must not use hindsight, 
which includes knowledge of the inventio n, in addressing the statutory question of obviousness  [72]. 
Ninthly, it is necessary to consider whether a feature of a claimed invention is an added benefit in a 
context in which the claimed innovation is obvious for another purpose  [73]. A tenth conside ration  is 
the nature of the invention . In this case, the Court is concerned with a dosage patent with a Swiss -
form claim and an EPC 2000 claim. The possibility that a dosage patent with such claims may be valid 
has been recognized both by the EPO and in th e United Kingdom courts  [74]. 
 
In the present dispute, t he Court considers that t he balance or symmetry in patent law and the pre -
established or at least readily foreseeable target of the skilled team’s tests hold the key to its resolution. 
The prior art discloses an invention - that is the use of tadalafil in the treatment of ED - in a manner 
which enables the skilled person to perform it . The task which the notional skilled team would 
undertake was that of implementing patent EP 0 839 040  (“the Daugan pa tent”), which was the 
nearest prior art. The Daugan patent had disclosed th at doses of tadalafil for the treatment of ED will 
generally be in the range of 0.5mg to 800mg daily for the average adult patient. The target of the skilled 
team would be to ascert ain the appropriate dose, which would usually be the lowest effective dose. The 
skilled team would know of that target from the outset of its research. The pre -clinical and clinical tests 
involved familiar and routine procedures and normally progressed to the discovery of the dose -
response relationship in Phase IIb  [105] . 
 
In this case the trial judge’s findings of what would have been the sequence of the tests, which did not 
depend upon hindsight, included the finding, which the evidence clearly justified,  that the team, having 
found a therapeutic plateau, would be very likely to test lower doses and so come upon the dosage 
regime which is the subject matter of the patent  [105] . The Court  consider s that the Court of Appeal 
was entitled to treat the judge’s failure to appreciate the logical consequences of the finding - that it 
was very likely that the skilled team would continue the testing - as an error of principle which allowed 
an appellate court to carry out its own evaluation  [82]. As such, the Court is satisfied that the Court of 
Appeal was entitled to interfere with the trial judge’s assessment of obviousness and to hold that the 
181 patent was invalid for lacking an inventive step  [105] .

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Kitchin, with whom the rest of t he Court 
agrees, delivers the judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The starting point for a consideration of the proper interpretation of Note 1(b) to Schedule 9,  Group 
6, Item 1 of the VAT Act must be articles 131 to 133 of the Principal VAT Directive. Th ese make 
clear that member states must exempt transactions involving the provision of, among other things, 
university education by bodies governed by public law having such education as their aim. Member The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 states must also exempt transactions by other organi sations which they have recognised as having 
similar objects to those governed by public law and which also have education as their aim [41]. The 
general objective of the exemptions is  to ensure that access to the higher educational services is not 
hindere d by the increased costs that would result if those services were subject to VAT  [43]. 
 
Parliament has chosen to exercise the discretion conferred upon it by exempting from VAT  the 
provision of education by a United Kingdom university and any college of su ch a university. The term 
“university” is not defined in the VAT Act. However, the conditions under which a body in the United 
Kingdom is entitled to use the word university in its title are regulated by statute. Over 100 bodies are 
presently entitled to c all themselves a university and they vary greatly in character. A small but 
nonetheless significant number of them are private and run for profit  [46].  
 
It is against the background of the range of possible arrangements between universities and their 
colleges that the meaning of the phrase “college of such a university” in Note (1)(b) falls to be 
determined  [47]. In Lord Kitchin’s judgment the following points are material  [47]. First, for its 
activities to fall within the scope of Item 1(a), any college o f a university, as an eligible body, must 
provide education  [48]. Secondly, the supply of educational services is exempt only if it is provided by 
bodies governed by public law or by other bodies recognised by the member state as having similar 
object s [49]. Thirdly, there is nothing in Note 1(b) or the broader context which would justify limiting 
the scope of the phrase “any college of such a university” to colleges which are a constituent part of a 
university in a constitutional or structural sense. To th e contrary, if satisfaction of such a constituent 
part test were required, it would effectively exclude commercial providers such as SEL from the 
exemption for it is a test they will rarely if ever be able to satisfy  [50]. Fourthly, it is necessary to 
exam ine the characteristics of those educational services and the context in which they are delivered 
rather than the precise nature of the legal and constitutional relationship between the body that 
provides them and its university  [51]. 
 
Lord Kitchin recogni ses that  the presence of a foundation or constitutional document or some other 
legal relationship establishing the college as a constituent part of the university in a constitutional or 
structural sense will be sufficient to prove that it is a college of t he university within the meaning of 
Note 1(b), save in an exceptional case . However,  that is not a necessary condition. In assessing 
whether a body is a college of a university the following five questions are also likely to be highly 
relevant: (i) whether  they have a common understanding that the body is a college of the university; (ii) 
whether the body can enrol or matriculate students as students of the university; (iii) whether those 
students are generally treated as students of the university during t he course of their period of study; 
(iv) whether the body provides courses of study which are approved by the university; and (v) whether 
the body can in due course present its students for examination for a degree from the university  [53]. 
If a body can e stablish the presence of each of these five features , then it is highly likely to be a college 
of the  university within the meaning of Note 1(b). This is not to  suggest that that there may not be 
other cases where the degree of integration of the activitie s of the body and the university is such that 
it may properly be described as a college of the university.  All will depend on the particular 
circumstances of the case  [54]. 
 
Lord Kitchin concludes that t he factual findings of the FTT were sufficient to jus tify its conclusion 
that SEL’s activities were integrated into those of MU and that it shared the objects of MU. The FTT 
was entitled to find that in May 2009 SEL became and thereafter remained a college of MU within the 
meaning of Schedule 9, Group 6, Ite m 1, Note (1)(b) of the VAT Act  [73].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeal . It decides that a person who applies to set aside an 
earlier judgment on  the basis of fraud does not have to demonstrate that the evidence of this fraud could 
not have been obtained with reasonable diligence in advance of the earlier trial. Lord Kerr , Lord  Sumption, 
Lord Briggs and Lady Arden all write judgments.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
Lord Kerr  (with whom Lord Hodge, Lord Lloyd -Jones and Lord Kitchin agree) : The existence or non -
existence of fraud had not been decided by HHJ Purle. It is therefore a new issue which does not involve 
the re -litigation of an identical claim [21].  
 
The former House of Lords and Privy Council authorities on which the respondent relied are not authority 
for the proposition that, in cases where it is alleged that a judgment was obtained by fraud, it may only be 
set aside where the party who makes that application can demonstrate that the fraud could not have been 
uncovered with reasonable diligence in advance of the judgment [54].  
 
It is a basic principle that the law does not expect people to arrange their affairs on the basis that others 
may com mit fraud [44]. Australian and Canadian courts have both recognised a special place occupied by 
fraud in the setting aside of judgments  and the reasoning in these cases is compelling  [48 – 52]. It is 
contrary to justice that a fraudulent individual should profit because their opponent fails to act with 
reasonable  diligence . A person who obtains a judgment through fraud deceives not only their opponent but 
also the court and the rule of law. It would also seem wrong if a person could be sent to prison for 
fraudulent conduct and yet remain able to enforce a judgment they obtained because  of that fraud [52].  
 
Lord Sumption  (with whom Lord Hodge, Lord Lloyd -Jones and Lord Kitchin agree) : An action to set aside 
an earlier judgment for fraud is not a procedural a pplication but a cause of action [60]. This cause of action 
is independent of the cause of action asserted in the earlier proceedings  and there can therefore be no 
question of cause of action estoppel. There is also no question of issue estoppel, because t he basis of the 
action is that the earlier decision is vitiate d by fraud and cannot bind the parties  [61].  
 
Abuse of process is a concept relating to th e court’s procedural powers. Previous House of Lords cases 
have established that where a question could  have been but was not raised in earlier proceedings , the court’s 
power to restrain abusive re -litigation is subject to a degree of flexibility  [62]. Re-litigation is abusive not 
only where the point could have been argued  previously  but where it should ha ve been . A person is entitled 
to assume honesty on the part of others, so an application would only be abusive  if a claimant deliberately 
decided not to investigate a suspected fraud or rely on a known one [63].  
 
A more flexible and fact sensitive approac h to these cases would introduce an unacceptable element of 
discretion into the enforcement of a substantive right. The standard of proof for fraud is high but, once it is 
satisfied, there are no degrees of fraud which can affect the right to have a judgme nt set aside  [64]. 
 
Lord Briggs : This case involves a conflict between two important and long -established principles of public 
policy. Firstly, the principle that fraud unravels all  and, secondly, the principle that there must come an end 
to litigation . In this case, the fraud principle should prevail . However, instead of a bright -line rule,  the court 
should apply a fact -intensive approach to the question of whether a lack of diligence in earlier proceedings 
really does  render a future claim to set aside a judgment on the basis of fraud an abuse of process . This 
should start from the position that a litigant has a legal right to have set aside a judgment obtained by fraud 
which is not dependant upon having exercised reasonable diligence in the earlier procee dings.  [68].  
 
Lady Arden : There is no reasonable diligence rule barring fresh actions based on fraud  [91]. Usually, a 
judgment obtained by fraud should be set aside.  It is wrong in principle that a fraudster should retain the 
fruits of his fraud but ther e are some exceptions to this rule [92 – 93]. If a party suspected a fraud and did 
not investigate it, any restriction on access to court would have to be compliant with the European 
Convention on Human Rights , so any restriction on the claimant’s rights c ould go no further than 
necessary [94]. There are factors on both sides. However, the reasonable diligence rule is illogical as it 
automatically imposes a sanction which could be wholly disproportionate to the lack of diligence  [98].

The Supreme Court  dismisses  the appeal . Lord Briggs gives the lead judgment, with which all members 
of the Court agree. Income tax must be deducted  before payment of  statutor y interest to  the creditors.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Rule 14.23(7) of the 2016 Rules, which replaced substantially identical provisions in rule 2.88(7) of the 
Insolvency Rules 1986, requires a surplus after payment of proved debts in an administrati on to be 
used for payment of statutory interest [1]. Interest is paid as statutory compensation for the loss which 
the creditors have suffered by being kept out of their money during the administration [6].   
 
Section 874 of the 2007 Act, which is  a much m ore historic provision  within the income tax legislation , 
requires a debtor to deduct income tax from payments of “yearly interest” arising in the UK [1, 11-15]. 
Historically, the income tax legislation adopted a dichotomy between the treatment of interest  of any 
kind which is not paid out of profits or gains, on the one hand, and yearly interest, on the other hand 
[15]. The mandatory deduction at source of yearly interest remains in place for interest paid by 
companies as well as certain other categories o f taxpayers, and interest paid by any person to someone 
whose usual place of abode is outside the UK [15]. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 There are two lines of English and Scottish case law that are relevant to th is appeal. The first deals 
with whether interest which accrues over time  is properly categorised as yearly interest  [20]. The 
second i s mainly concerned with interest payable as a result of a judicial decision, either when granting 
an equitable remedy or when exercising a discretion to award interest under statute  [20]. Howeve r, 
statutory interest under rule 14.23(7) of the 2016 Rules does not strictly fall within either category.   
The answer to the question on appeal must thus be found by analogy  [20].  
 
In the first  line of case s, a number of  general tests for whether intere st is yearly interest  or not  were 
laid down  [21-29]. These were summarised by the Court of Session in Inland Revenue Comrs v Hay 
(1924) VIII TC 636 (“the Hay tests”). In summary: (1) interest payable on so-called  short loan s is not 
yearly interest ; (2) for  interest to be yearly interest , there must be some element of permanence in the 
contractual arrangement under which it is payable ; (3) the arrangement under which interest is payable 
must be in the nature of an investment ; (4) the loan must not be one re payable on demand ; and         
(5) there must be some ‘tract of future time’ during which interest will continue to be payable  [30]. 
The Hay tests remain the best convenient summary about the meaning of yearly interest in the context 
of interest which accru es over time [33].  
 
In the second line of cases, the same question has been addressed in the context of interest usually 
payable in a single lump sum [34]. The most important case is the House of Lords decision in Riches v 
Westminster Bank Ltd [1947] AC 3 90 [36-42]. In most of these cases, interest became payable only after 
the event (and usually in one lump sum) upon the order of the court and it served as compensation for 
being deprived of money or property during a past period [34, 47-48]. Relevant exam ples include 
cases where a trustee has misused trust property and cases  where the court has ordered interest to be 
paid on damages, such as for personal injury, until the date of judgment [34-48]. Where that period 
exceeds a year, interest was held to be y early interest for income tax purposes  [52].    
 
Interest payable  on a surplus  in an administration is of a special type  [49]. Such interest, once paid, 
compensates proving creditors for being kept out of their proved debts  in respect of the period from 
the beginning of the administration until the y are actually paid [49]. Consequently, t he relevant analogy 
is to the second line of cases [47-48, 52]. This is because in both the present appeal and those cases 
there is no liability to pay interest during the period in respect of which it is calculated , and the interest 
is not itself payable over a period of time [47-48]. Moreover, in both cases, it cannot be known during 
the period of calculation whether interest will in fact be payable at all [47-48]. In both , the interest 
amounts to compensation for the recipients having been out of their money [48, 52] . There is no 
relevant uncertainty, because, like in the trust and personal injury cases, the taxpayer will know to 
which period the interest relates by the ti me it becomes due and thus make suitable tax deductions 
[54]. In the present case, the period is fixed by the date of commencement of the administration and 
the date (or dates) when the proving creditors are paid their debts [54].  
 
Arguments based on the source of the relevant income conflict with the second line of cases [55-56]. 
Further, they are wrong in principle  as: (1) the income tax deduction obligation under section 874 of 
the 2007 Act does not depend on whether the interest is taxable in the hands  of the recipient; (2) it is 
artificial to regard the source of statutory interest as either  the realisation of the surplus or the 
administrators’ decision to pay interest; and (3), if anything, the relevant status of the recipient is as a 
proving creditor  between the start of the administration and payment of the principal debt [57-59].  
 
On the present facts, the result is that the statutory interest payable is yearly interest  [61]. Therefore, 
income tax is to be deducted at source pursuant to section 874  of the 2007 Act  [61].

The Supreme Court dismisses  the appeal . Lord Lloyd -Jones gives the sole judgment with which the other Justices 
agree. 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The question in this appeal is: where a person has already had a human rights clai m refused and there is no 
pending appeal, do further submissions that rely on human rights grounds have to be accepted by the Secretary 
of State as a fresh claim in accordance with rule 353 if a decision in response to those representations is to attract 
a right of appeal under section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (‘the 2002 Act’) [1]? The 
appellant raise s two principal arguments for why they do not . 
 
1. BA (Nigeria)  
 
The appellant submits  that the line of authority beginning with R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p 
Onibiyo [1996] QB 768, which established that it was for the Secretary of State to decide whether further The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960  1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 submissions constituted a fresh claim giving rise to a right of appeal, did not survive the Supreme C ourt’s 
decision in BA (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] UKSC 7 [26]. The Court disagrees as BA 
(Nigeria)  was limited to cases where the further submissions have been rejected  and there was an appealable 
decision  [50]. Its reason s are as follows : 
 
(1) BA (Nigeria) establishe d that, where the Secretary of State receives further submissions on which he makes an 
immigration decision within section 82 of the 2002 Act , in the absence of certification there will be an in -
country right of app eal. Onibiyo and rule 353, by contrast, address a prior issue of whether there is a claim 
requiring a decision at all [46]. 
(2) The 2002 Act, particularly the powers of certification under sections 94 and 96, do es not render Onibiyo and 
rule 353 redundant. The effect of rule 353 is that no right of appeal ever arises, rather than only to limit to an 
out-of-country appeal, and it operates at a prior stage to section 94. Section 96(1) addresses a different aspect 
of renewed claims, as it applies where a person re lies on a matter that could have been raised in an earlier 
appeal but has no satisfactory reason for not doing so [47]. 
(3) Parliament did not intend the 2002 Act to provide a comprehensive code for dealing with repeat claims or 
for rule 353 no longer to be ef fective. There was no attempt to repeal rule 353’s predecessor  and Parliament 
has approved subsequent amendments to the Immigration Rules that did not delete rule 353.  Moreover , 
following the amendment of the 2002 Act in 2014, rule 353 was amended to ensur e it applies to human 
rights claims and protection claims, which suggest s it was still effective [48]. 
(4) The appellant’s  broad reading of BA (Nigeria) is inconsistent with  ZT (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home 
Department [2009] UKHL 6, in which  the H ouse of Lords held that the Secretary of State had erred in 
applying section 94(2) of the 2002 Act rather than rule 353 in considering further submissions. BA (Nigeria) 
merely decided that rule 353 has no part to play once there is an appealable immigratio n decision. It contains 
no express statement that it intends to overrule or depart from ZT (Kosovo) , and it is extremely improbable 
that that was the intention  [49]. 
 
2. 2014 Amendments to the 2002 Act  
 
The appellant submits that the amendments to the 2002 Ac t effected by the Immigration Act 2014  
fundamentally changed the operation of the statutory scheme , with the result that rule 353 no longer applies 
[58]. The Court reject s these submissions for the following reasons:  
 
(1) Referring to rule 353 to determine if subsequent submissions are a “human rights claim” does not result in 
the same words bearing different meanings. In BA (Nigeria)  there was in each case a “human rights claim”, 
but there was a right of appeal against an immigration decision , so the interpret ation of “human rights claim” 
did not need to refer to rule 353. In this case, the issue is the prior question of whether there is a claim at all  
[59]. 
(2) The 2014 amendments limit appeals to where there has been a refusal of a protection claim or a human 
rights claim, or the revocation of  protection status . The structure and operation of section 82 remains 
unchanged. The amended section 82 does not relieve a person of the burden of establishing that the 
Secretary of State has refused a valid human rights clai m [60]. 
(3) Parliament is presumed to legislate in the knowledge of and having regard to relevant judicial decisions. In 
the present context, the Court of Appeal in ZA (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2010] 
EWCA Civ 926 had provided an a uthoritative explanation of the effect of BA (Nigeria) . Parliament is 
therefore assumed to have legislated in light of a consistent line of authority establish ing that a purported 
human rights claim short of the threshold of a fresh claim under rule 353 wa s not a claim at all. There is 
nothing in the 2014 amendments to suggest Parliament intended to enable repeated claims raising human 
rights issues to generate multiple appeals [62].  
 
Therefore , “human rights claim” in section 82 of the amended 2002 Act me ans an original human rights claim or 
a fresh human rights claim within rule 353. As a result, the Secretary of State’s response to the appellant’s further 
submissions did not attract a right of appeal  [64].

The Supreme Court  (Lady Hale, Lord Wilson, Lady Black, Lord Briggs and Lord Kitchin ) unanimously 
allows the appeal  and remits KV’s appeal against the refusal of asylum to the Upper Tribunal  for fresh 
determination. Lord Wilson gives the only judgment.  
 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The 1999 “Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentati on of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment” , known as the  “Istanbul Protocol” , guides medical experts to indicate for each lesion 
the degree of consistency between it and the cause  given by the patient, on a scale from “not consistent” to 
“diagnostic of” . The Istanbul Protocol provides that “ultimately, it is the overall evaluation of all lesions, and not the 
consistency of each lesion with a particular form of torture that is important in assessing the torture story…” . Thus , in 
concluding that his clinical findings were “highly consistent” with KV’s account, Dr Zapata -Bravo framed  his 
conclusion in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol [15]-[17]. 
 
In the Supreme Court , the Home Secretary felt unable to defend the CA’s observ ations that Dr Zapata -
Bravo had gone beyond his remit. In their difficult task of analysing whether scars are the result of torture, 
decision -makers can legitimately receive assistance from medical experts who feel able to offer an opinion 
about the consis tency of their findings with the asylum -seeker’s account about the circumstances in which 
the scarring was sustained, not limited to the mechanism by which it was sustained. The CA’s suggestion 
that the references in the Istanbul Protocol to the “trauma de scribed” relate only to the mechanism by which 
injury is said to have been caused is too narrow a construction of the word “trauma”  [20]-[21]. 
 
On the other hand, unless an expert finds that the trauma described is either “not consistent with” or “diagnost ic 
of” the alleged torture, it would be beyond his or her  remit to state that he or she  “believed” the appellant. 
The conclusion about credibility always rests with the decision -maker following a survey of all the evidence 
[25]. 
 
This approach is consisten t with that of the Court of Appeal in a previous case  of alleged torture , and that 
of the European Court of Human Rights [22]-[23]. An expert investigating  an allegation of torture  should 
recognise the Istanbul Protocol as equally authoritative to the rele vant Practice Direction on expert  
evidence in immigration and asylum cases  at the FTT and the tribunal  [24].  
 
As for the decision of the tribunal, Elias LJ in his dissenting judgment had noted various problems with the 
tribunal’s reasons for rejecting KV’ s account of torture  [26]. In particular, the tribunal’s summary of the 
doctor’s evidence lacked apparent awareness that the scarring with precise edging was only on KV’s back, 
and addressed a hypothesis , not advanced by the  doctor or KV, that KV was uncon scious while the hot 
metal rods were applied to his arms as well as to his back [28].  
 
Given  KV’s serious lack of credibility in several areas, the tribunal was correct to address the possibility of 
wounding SIPB. However, when the tribunal concluded that  there were only two real possibilities – either 
that KV had been tortured or that the wounding was SIBP  – and when it rejected the former, it failed to 
take into account the fact that self -infliction of wounds is inherently unlikely. There is evidence of 
extensive torture by state forces in Sri Lanka at the relevant time. By contrast, evidence of wounding SIBP 
on the part of asylum -seekers is almost non -existent. It is an extreme measure for a person to decide to 
cause himself deep injury and severe pain. Moreover, if KV’s wounding was SIBP, the wounds on his back 
could only have been inflicted under anaesthetic so he would have needed the assistance of someone with 
medical expertise. The Supreme Court approves Elias LJ’s view that very considerable weight should be 
given to the fact that injuries which are SIBP are likely to be extremely rare [31]-[35].

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Court of Appeal  in Northern Ireland  held that in so-called ‘legacy’ cases, which concern deaths that 
occurred in Northern Ireland during the ‘Troubles’, “the issue of damages against any public authority for breach 
of the adjectival obligation in article 2  ECHR  [i.e. the obligation to investigate the circumstances of the death] ought to be 
dealt with once the inquest has finally been determined ”. This appeared to constitute general guidance , and, 
consistently with this, the Court of Appeal ordered  that “the claim for damages for breach of the article 2 
procedural requirement that an inquest be conducted ‘promptly’ should not be brought until the inquest has finally been 
determined ”. [16]-[17] The appeal was against this part of the Court of Appeal’s  order . [20] 
 
After the hearing of this appeal, the Court of Appeal , in another legacy case, In Re McCord’s Application 
for Judicial Review , clarified the remarks  in Jordan , so that it appears that it intends the guidance to be 
confined to cases where damages are the only outstanding issue and where an inquest can be expected 
to begin in the near future, if not already under  way. Further, the appropriateness of the stay should be 
kept under review, and it should be lifted if the claim for damages will otherwise not  be determined 
within a reasonable time. [24] 
 
Lord Reed  states  that “ it must be borne in mind at the outset that, in cases of the present kind, it is the delay itself 
which constitutes a breach of the claimant’s Convention rights ” and that “ [t]he breach d oes not crystallise only after the 
inquest has been concluded ”. [25] Section 7(1)(a)  of the HRA , pursuant to which claims arising from such 
delay are brought, confers a statutory right on any person to bring proceedings against a public authority 
that acted in a way which was incompatible with their Convention right.  [26] No court can take that 
statutory right away. [27] However, it can exercise powers of case management , including ordering a 
stay, but, when doing so , three important aspects of Conventi on rights must be borne in mind.  [28]  
 
First, Convention  rights must be practical and effective . [29] Second, a stay will be unlawful if it results 
in a breach of the “reasonable time” guarantee in article 6  of the Convention . [31]-[32] Third, a stay also 
engages another aspect of article 6, namely the guarantee of an effective right of access to a court. It 
must therefore pursue a legitimate aim, and there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality 
between the means employed an d the aim sought to be achieved. [33] This requires an assessment of 
the weight of the competing interests in the particular case : the risk of a proliferation of litigation, the 
avoidance of which was the legitimate aim pursued by the  stay, against the imp ortance to the claimant 
of obtaining monetary redress for the violation of his or her Convention rights without avoidable delay.  
There may be factors in individual cases which make the expeditious determination of the claim 
particularly important. The present case, for example, illustrates the importance of avoiding delay  where 
proceedings are brought by claimants who are elderly or  infirm , since Hugh Jordan’s health has so 
deteriorated that his wife had to take  over the conduct of the se proceedings. [37] 
 
On its face, t he guidance given by the Court of Appeal in the present case involved no assessment of 
proportionality or considera tion of individual circumstances. It was also liable to render the article 2 
procedural right ineffective  resulting  in breaches of the reasonable time guarantee. [39] However, the  
McCord judgment  resolved this . Nevertheless,  it remains necessary to conside r whether that general 
guidance shou ld be applied in the circumstances of an individual case . In the present case , the stay was 
imposed without any evident consideration of its proportionality . It is uncertain whether it would have 
been imposed if proporti onality had been considered in the light of all the relevant facts, including Hugh 
Jordan’s declining health. T he appeal is therefore allowed. [41]-[42]

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal . Lord Lloyd -Jones  gives the sole judgment with 
which the other Justices agree.  The Supre me Court of the United Kingdom

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
At the hear t of the present appeal lies the issue of the characterisation of the appellant as an accused 
person or a convicted person. The EAW system is founded on the high level of mutual trust and 
confidence between member states and, as a result, in seeking to giv e effect to this distinction when 
applying implementing legislation, a national court will usually attach considerable weight to the 
description by the requesting judicial authority in the EAW of the position in its own national law . The 
view of the reques ting judicial authority will  not always be conclusive , but it will normally be influential 
and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is likely to be followed [18]. 
 
The Court considers  that the appellant’s case founded on EU law is not made out  [28]. It also  
consider s that the appellant’s case is inconsistent with the EAW scheme and the express provisions of 
the 2003 Act  [34]. The express provisions in their natural meaning provide a coherent structure within 
which to address all cases of trial in absentia  [37].  
 
The Court  consider s that the following principles should be applied by a court in this jurisdiction when 
seeking to characterise a case as an accusation case or a conviction case  [50]: 
(1) The dichotomy drawn by the Framework Decision between  accusation warrants and conviction 
warrants is a matter of EU law. The Framework Decision does not have direct effect but national 
implementing legislation should, so far as possible, be interpreted consistently with its terms.  
(2) The court should seek to ca tegorise the relevant facts by reference to their status and effects in the 
law and procedure of the member state of the requesting judicial authority.  
(3) Ordinarily, statements made by the requesting judicial authority in the EAW or in supplementary 
communic ations will be taken to be an accurate account of its law and procedure but evidence may 
be admitted to contradict them.  
(4) A person may properly be regarded as convicted for this purpose if the conviction is binding and 
enforceable under the law and procedur e of the member state of the requesting authority.  
(5) For this purpose, it is not a requirement that a conviction should be final in the sense of being 
irrevocable. In particular, a convicted person who has a right to a retrial may, nevertheless, be 
properly considered a convicted person for this purpose, provided that the conviction is binding 
and enforceable in the law and procedure of the member state of the requesting authority.  
(6) While the view of the requesting judicial authority on the issue of characteri sation cannot be 
determinative, the question whether a conviction is binding and enforceable will depend on the law 
of that member state.  
 
The Court accept s that where  a person with a right to a retrial is correctly classified as a convicted 
person for the  purposes of the 2003 Act  it could work to his disadvantage in the operation of section 
14 because the passage of time prior to his conviction is excluded from consideration. This is a 
deficiency in the drafting of the statute which requires consideration by the legislature at an early 
opportunity  [54]. However, u ntil such time as section 14 can be amended by Parliament, article 8  of 
the ECHR  provides an appropriate and effective alternative means of addressing passage of time 
resulting in injustice or oppr ession in cases where the defendant has been convicted in absentia  [58]. 
 
In th is case, District Judge Ashworth correctly characterised the EAW as a conviction warrant.  The 
EAW indicated there was an enforceable judgment and a legally effective conviction which would 
remain such until revoked.  The Court was satisfied that  full and appropriate account was taken of the 
passage of time since the offences were allegedly committed , and the appellant has not been 
disadvantaged in any way as a result  [70]. For the se reasons , the Court  dismiss es the appeal  [72].

The Supreme Court holds that Mrs Finucane did have a legitimate expectation that there would be a 
public inquiry into Mr Finucane’ s death, but that Mrs Finucane has not shown that the government’s 
decision not to fulfil  this promise was made in bad faith or that it was not based on genuine policy 
grounds. The Supreme Court makes a declaration that there has not been an Article 2 comp liant 
inquiry into the death of Mr Finucane. Lord Kerr gives a judgment with which all members of the 
Court agree. Lord Carnwath delivers a concurring judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Legitimate Expectation: Where a clear and unambiguous undertaking is made, the authority giving 
the undertaking will not be allowed to depart from it unless it is shown that it is fair to do so  [62].  
 
The undertakings given by the various ministers amount, individually and cumulatively, to an 
unequivocal undertaking to ho ld a public inquiry into Mr Finucane’s death  [68]. This promise was not 
of a substantive benefit to a limited class of individuals. Instead, it was a policy statement about 
procedure . That policy procedure applied not only to Mrs Finucane but also to the w orld at large [63].  
 
If political issues overtake a promise given by the government and a decision is taken in good faith and 
on genuine polic y grounds not to adhere to the original promise, it will be difficult for a person who 
holds a legitimate expecta tion to enforce compliance with it [76]. Mrs Finucane’s argument that the 
process was a sham and the outcome was fixed is a serious charge which would require clear evidence 
before this could be accepted [77 – 78]. There is no sustainable evidence to this effect , so this part of 
Mrs Finucane’s appeal fails  [81].   
 
Whilst this issue did not arise on the facts of the present case, Lord Carnwath delivers a concurring 
judgment addressing the issue of detriment in substantive legitimate expectation cases [156 – 160].  
 
Article 2 of the ECHR : Article 2 gives rise  not merely to a duty not to kill people but, where there is 
an issue as to whether the state had broken this obligation, a n obligation on the part of the state to 
carry out an effective official investig ation into the deaths  [83]. 
 The Supreme Court o f the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Mr Finucane died prior to 2 October 2000, which is the date when the HRA  (which gives effect to the 
ECHR in domestic law)  came into force [84]. The procedural obligation to investigate can be 
considered a detachable obligation , however. In that role, it  is capable of binding the state even where 
the death took place before the critical date  when these laws came into force  [96]. The SSNI  argued 
that there must be a genuine connection between the death and the critical date , and t hat this ha d not  
been established in this case  [106 – 107]. It was suggested that the period between the death and the 
critical date should not exceed ten years. It was held that there was not an absolute rule  that the period 
between the death and the crit ical date should be ten years or less. T he period between the dates is 
important  but the significance of this diminishes where, as in this case , most  of the significant inquir ies 
into the death took place  after the HRA came into force  [108].  
 
It has been established by the ECtHR that  any information or material which has the potential to 
undermine the conclusions of an earlier investigation or to allow an earlier inconclusive investigation 
to be pursued further would prompt a revival of the procedural obli gation [117] .  
 
The need for an effective investigation goes well beyond facilitating a prosecution [127] . In order to be 
compliant, an investigation must be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those 
responsible [128] . This must invo lve having the means to identify those implicated in the death [131] .  
 
Various features show that Sir Desmond’s review fell short of being an effective Article 2 compliant 
inquiry: Sir Desmond did not have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses, those who met 
him were not subject to testing as to the accuracy of their evidence, and a potentially critical witness 
was excused attendance for questioning . The review by Sir Desmond, even when taken with earlier 
inquiries , was not sufficient to fulfil t he requirements of Article 2 [134] .  
 
Mrs Finucane’s representative had declined an invitation made by the Court of Appeal to amend her 
application and plead, as a freestanding issue, that the state was in breach of its Article 2 obligations . 
Notwithstandi ng this,  the issue of whether there was a breach of the procedural obligation under 
Article 2 was  before this Court  and called for determination  [151] . In any event, the confines of the 
deliberations of the Supreme Court are not necessarily determined by t he manner in which the parties 
choose to make their presentations . Whilst it is unnecessary to decide this point  in the present appeal , 
to allow a violation of an ECHR right to go unremarked upon may well be in breach of the spirit, if 
not the literal requ irement, of section 6 of the HRA [152].

The Supreme Court allows the appeal . The Court of Appeal’s order is set aside and that of District 
Judge Wright is reinstated . Lord Sumption gives th e lead judgment, with which all the Justices agree.     
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Part VI of the Road Traffic Act 1988  applies in this appeal . Section 145 requires there to be an 
insurance policy against third party risks “in relation to the use of the vehicle” by the particular driver, 
while section 151(5)  requires the insurer to satisfy any judgment falling within section 151 (2), subject to The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt .uk 
 certain conditions . Under  section 151(2)(b) , an insurer who has issued a policy in relation to the use of 
a vehicle is liable on a judgment, even where it was obtained against a n uninsured  driver . [3]  
 
The MIB has entered into agreements with the Secretary of State to compensate third party victims of 
road accidents not even covered by section 151 (2)(b). This means  victims suffering personal injury  or 
property damage caused by (1 ) uninsured vehicles an d (2) drivers who cannot be traced.  Clause 4(d) of 
the 2003 Untraced Drivers Agreement (“the 2003 Agreement”)  is applicable in Ms Cameron’s case . [4] 
 
It is a fundamental feature of the statutory scheme of compulsory insurance in the U K that it does not 
confer on victims a  direct right of recovery against an insurer for the underlying liability of the driver . 
The only direct right against the insurer is the right to require it to satisfy a judgment against the driver,  
under section 151,  once the driver ’s liability has been established in legal proceedings.  Consistent  with 
this approach, t he 2003  Agreement assumes that judgment cannot be obtained against the driver if he 
cannot be identified, and therefore  the only recourse is against the MIB, not the insurer . [5, 22] 
 
The general rule remains that proceedings may not be brought against unnamed parties , as is implicit 
in the limited exceptions contemplated by the Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”)  [9]. The main exceptions 
are: (1) possession actions against trespas sers, (2) actions  and orders where some of the wrongdoers 
were known so they could be sued both pers onally and as representing their  unidentified associates  
and ( 3) the wider  jurisdiction recognised in Bloomsbury Publishing Group Plc v News Group Newspaper s Ltd  
[2003] 1 WLR 1633  (Ch) [10].  
 
The key distinction is between two classes of unnamed defendant cases: (1) anonymous defendants 
who are identifiable but whose names are unknown  and (2) defendants , such as in most hit and run 
drivers, who are not only anonymous but cannot even be identified . In category  (1), defendant s are 
described in  such a way that it  is at least possible to locate or communicate with  them, and to 
determine whether they are  the person described in the claim form . In category (2), thi s is not possible . 
[13] 
 
This appeal is not directly concerned with service  – it is about the issue or amendment of the claim 
form  – but the legitimacy of issu ing or amend ing can be tested against  the possibility of service [14]. 
An identifiable but  anonym ous defendant can be served , if necessary  by CPR r.6.15 alternative service  
[15]. Interim injunction cases can fall in category (1), because  the process of enforcing the injunction 
will sometimes be enough to bring the proceedings to the defendant’s attent ion, as in Bloomsbury  [15]. 
However, an unknown person is not identified simply by referring to past actions  [16]. Proceedings 
against such a person  (in category (2) ) offend  the fundamental principle of justice that a person cannot 
be made subject to the j urisdiction of the court without having such notice of the proceeding s as will 
enable a fair hearing [17-18]. While CPR r.6.15 permits alternative service, the mode of service  should  
be such as can  reasonably be expected to bring the proceedings to the  defendant’s attention  [20-21]. 
 
Applying these principles to the present appeal,  alternat ive service against an unidentifiable person 
referred to in the proceedings only by a pseudonym or description cannot be justified . In particular , 
ordinary service on the  insurer would not constitute service on the driver , and alternative service could 
not be expected to reach the driver of the Micra . Nor would it be appropriate to di spense with service 
under CPR r.6.16  in a case where it could not be shown that the defend ant knew of the proceedings.  
[21-26]  
 
As to the  EU law i ssue on the Sixth Motor Insurance Directive, the Supreme Court considers no point 
on the Directive arises  because : (1) Ms Cameron is not trying to assert a direct right against the insurer 
for the un derlying wrong  (her claim is for damages from the driver)  and (2)  it is consistent with the 
Directive to require a claim against  the MIB, not the insurer, in this class of case [27-30].

The Supreme Court allows the appeal  and restores the order of the County Court judge . Lord Brigg s

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Loss of chance damages have been developed by the courts to deal with the difficulties arising from 
the assessment of counter -factual and future events [16]. In both types of situation, the court s at times 
depart from the ordinary burden on a claimant to prove the facts requir ed for a successful claim on the 
balance of probabilities  (i.e. more likely than not)  standard  [17-18]. However, this does not mean that 
the basic requirement that a negligence claim requires proof that loss has been caused by the breach of 
duty is abandoned [19]. The correct approach, following Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons & Simmons 
[1995] 1 WLR 1602 (CA), is to require a claimant t o prove what he or she would have done on the 
balance of probabilities, while what others would have done (if relevant ) depends on a loss of chance 
evaluation [20-21]. These principles apply equally to negligence claims based on loss of the 
opportunity to achieve a better outcome in a negotiated transaction and ones , as in this case,  based on 
loss of the chance  to bring  a legal claim [22].  
 
It is not unfair to subject medical and oral evidence as to facts within the claimant’s own knowledge to 
forensic ana lysis on the balance of probabilities standard [30]. The case law only establishes that, 
where the question for  the court is one which turns on the assessment of a lost chance, it is generally 
inappropriate to conduct a trial within a trial [31]. It does not establish a principle that it is always 
wrong to try an issue relevant to causation in a professional negligence case, merely because that issue 
would have fallen for determination in the underlying claim (lost due to alleged  negligence) [35-37]. 
Whethe r an issue should be tried  to the usual standard  depends  on whether it concerns the claimant’s 
conduct ( where it should  be) or third party conduct ( only requiring a real and substantial chance) [37].        
 
Applying this approach, Mr Perry needed to prove  that, properly advised by Raleys, he would have 
made a claim to a Services Award under the Scheme within time [25]. Further, the judge was correct to 
impose the additional requirement of the claim having to be an honest claim [25]. A concession in the 
courts below had been rightly made as to the honest claim requirement, because: (1) a claimant giving 
an honest description of his or her condition to a solicitor would not be advised to bring a claim if the 
facts were insufficient ; (2) a court may fairly pre sume that the client would only make honest claims; 
and (3) it is not the proper role of the courts to reward dishonest claimants [25-27]. 
 
On the facts, Mr Perry had to believe the  following to bring an honest claim: (1) before developing  
VWF, he had carr ied out all or some  of the six tasks without assistance; (2) after developing  VWF , he 
needed assistance in carrying out all or some of those tasks ; and (3) the need for assistance was  due to 
complications from VWF [28]. Question (3)  might require expert me dical opinion, but all the other 
necessary elements  fell within his own knowledge  [29]. Such f acts do not raise issues of counter -
factuality or futurity  which e ngage loss of chance principles  [30]. Accordingly , Judge Saffman had 
made no legal error in cond ucting a trial of the issue whether Mr Perry would (or could ) have brought 
an honest claim for a Services Award  [41]. Further, the judge did not (wrongly)  apply a second  
causation hurdle  requir ing Mr Perry to prove that his claim would have been successful  (not merely 
honest) [42-48]. In addition, the Court of Appeal  wrong ly interfere d with the judge’s factual 
determination  – the very stringent test for appellate court interference was not met  in this case [49-66].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supr emecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
(i) Was there a binding contract?  
The question is whether , objectively assessed, the parties by their words and their conduct intended to 
create a legally binding relationship [17]. It may be the case t hat the words and conduct relied upon are 
so vague that the court is unable to identify the terms on which the parties have reached agreement . 
However, t he courts are reluctant to find an agreement is too vague or uncertain to be enforced where 
it is found  that the parties had the intention of being contractually bound and have acted on their 
agreement  [18]. In this case it  would naturally be understood that payment would become due on 
completion and made from the proceeds of sale  [19].  In short, Mr Devani  and Mr Wells agreed that if 
Mr Devani found a purchaser for the flats he would be paid his commission. Mr Wells  found the 
Newlon Housing Trust  and it became the purchaser on completion of the transaction. At that point, 
Mr Devani became entitled to his co mmission and it was payable from the proceeds of sale  [19].  
 
(ii) Implied term  
It was therefore unnecessary for the judge  to imply a term into the agreement between Mr Devani and 
Mr Wells. However, had it been necessary , there would be no hesitation in holding  that it was an 
implied term of the agreement that payment would fall due on completion of the purchase of the 
property by a person whom Mr Devani had introduced  [27]. The obligation to make payment of the 
commission on completion was required to give the agreement business efficacy and  would not go 
beyond what was necessary for that purpose  [29]. There will be cases where an agreement is so vague 
and uncertain that it cannot be enforced  [33]. However, e ach case must be considered in light of its 
own partic ular circumstances  [35]. 
 
(iii) The Estate Agents Act 1979  
Section 18(1) of the Act provides that before any person enters into a contract, the agent must give the 
client certain information  [37-39]. In this case, Mr Devani failed to comply with his section 18 
obligation because, i n particular, Mr Devani did not at the outset , or as soon as reasonably practicable 
thereafter , expressly inform Mr Wells of the event which would trigger his entitlement to commission; 
nor did he provide any of that information in writ ing [43]. However, i n the circumstances of this case, 
Mr Devani’s culpability was not so great as to justify dismissal of his application, and the trial judge 
made no material error in so deciding  [54]. 
 
As to whether once the  Court of Appeal  found that th e judge had made errors in the course of his 
assessment under section 18(6), it ought to have carried out the evaluation required by that provision 
afresh,  the law does not require such an inflexible approach  where, as here, the errors were of a minor 
kind and cannot have affected the conclusion to which he came. In these circumstances it is neither 
necessary nor appropriate for the appellate court to set that decision aside and embark on the 
evaluative exercise for itself  [55-56]. 
 
Lord Briggs agrees with Lord Kitchin  and with  his reasons [58]. Lord Briggs adds that t here are 
occasions, where the context in which the words are used tells you as much, or even more, about the 
essential terms of the bargain than the words themselves [59]. So it is with the con tract in the present 
case [60]. Lord  Briggs agrees that , like Lord Kitchin, he would have been prepared to find that a 
sufficiently certain and complete contract had been concluded between them, rather  than just by the 
implication of terms  [61]. Finally, L ord Briggs adds that n one of these  observations about the 
common law in any way under -rate the importance of the statutory duty in section 18 of the Act . On 
the contrary, i t is precisely because the common law will recognise an enforceable liability to pay  as 
arising from the briefest and most informal exchange between the parties that statute protects  
consumers by imposing a more rigorous discipline upon their professional counterparties  [63].

The Supreme Court dismisses  the appeal s (except in W’s case), but varies parts of the orders below. 
A majority of the  Court (Lord Sumption, Lord Carnwath, Lord Hughes and Lady Hale) reach that 
result based on a partial breach of the proportionality test. Lord Sumption (with whom Lord Carnwath 
and Lord Hughes agree) gives the lead judgment . Lady Hale (with whom Lord Carnwath also agrees) 
gives a concur ring judgment.  On the cross -appeal, the Court varies the order of the Divisional Court  
by adding a declaration that article 2A(3)(c) of the 1975 Order  is incompatible with Article 8 ECHR.  
Lord Kerr gives a se parate judgment , disagree ing with the majority’s approach  to the legality test and 
its application of the proportionality test . Lord Kerr would have dismissed the appeals  (including in 
W’s case)  and affirm ed the declarations of incompatibility  made by  the EWCA and NICA .  The Supreme Court of the United Ki ngdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
All members of the Supreme Court agree that  Article 8  ECHR is engaged and that two conditions thus 
apply, namely satisfactio n of: (1) the legality test and (2) the proportionality test [12], [73], [153] . They 
also all agree that the legality test requires, at least, accessibility and foreseeability [16], [73], [182] .  
Majority judgment s (Lord Sumption and Lady Hale) : 
Lord Sumption considers that the legality test, whether under Article 8 ECHR or otherwise, does n ot 
involve questions of degree [14]. For him, a ccessibility requires that it must be possible to discover 
what the provisions of a legal measure  are, while foreseeability requires that a measure does not confer 
an unconstrained discretion [17], [31] . Howev er, if the issue is how much discretion is too much  (i.e. a 
question of degree) , only the proportionality test can be used  for review [17]. In the ECHR case law, 
in particular MM v United Kingdom (App. No. 24029/07), the Strasbourg Court has treated the ne ed for 
safeguards as part of the foreseeability requirement and applied it as part of the legality  test in cases 
where a discretionary power would otherwise be unconstrained and lack certainty of application  [24]. 
There must be sufficient safeguards, exerc ised on known legal principles, against the arbitrary exercise 
of a discretion, so as to make its application reasonably foreseeable  [31]. 
Lord Sumption disagrees with the EWCA and NICA as to the effect of th e Supreme Court’s decision 
in R (T) v Chief Con stable of Greater Manchester Police [2014] UKSC 35 , concerning the regime governing 
disclosure of criminal records in England before the changes introduced in March 2014  [15], [35-41]. 
He does not accept that R (T) decided that a measure may  breach the leg ality test even where there is 
no relevant discretion and the relevant rules are precise and entirely clear  [37].  
For Lord Sumption , the rules governing the disclosure of criminal records  under both the 1974 Act 
and the 1997 Act are highly prescriptive , mandatory  and leave no discretion  [42]. There is thus no real 
difficulty in assessing the proportionality of the two statutory schemes , so the legality test is satisfied  –
both schemes are “in accordance with the law” for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR [42-45].  
As to proportionality, Lord Sumption considers that two questions arise: (1) whether the legislation 
can legitimately require disclosure by reference to pre -defined categories at all  and (2), if so, whether 
the current boundaries of these cate gories  are acceptable [46]. As to the first question, Lord Sumption 
considers that legislation by reference to pre -defined categories is justified [50]. This is because : (1) the 
final decision about the relevance of a conviction should be that of the employer, w ho is best placed to 
assess the individual circumstances; (2) there is limited evidence that employers cannot be trusted to 
take an objective view; (3) the 1997 Act scheme is carefully aligned with the disclosure scheme under 
the 1974 Act, necessitating  a category -based approach; and (4) it would be impracticable  to require a 
system of individual assessment [51-54]. On the second question, Lord Sumption considers that, with 
two exceptions, the carefully drawn categories in the legislation are not disproport ionate [61-62]. The 
first exception is the multiple conviction s rule, whi ch does not achieve its purpose  of indicating 
propensity as it applies irrespective  of the nature, similarity, number or time intervals of offences [63]. 
The second exception concerns  warnings and reprimands for younger offenders , the purpose of which 
is instructive and specifically designed to avoid damaging effects  later in life  through disclosure  [64].     
In P’s case, the disclosure was based on the multiple convictions rule  unde r the 1997 Act , so the appeal 
against the declaration of incompatibility falls to be dismissed  on that limited ground  [65]. However,  
as to P’s cross -appeal, article 2A(3)(c)  of the 1975 Order is only to be declared  incompatible with 
Article 8 ECHR  (rather than quashed)  [66]. As Mrs Gallagher’ s case  also concerns the multiple 
convictions rule, she is also entitled to a declaration of incompatibility both as to the 1997 Act and the 
1979 Order  [67]. In G’s case, concerning a reprimand against a younger offende r, the declaration of 
incompatibility as to the mandatory disclosure requirement under the 1997 Act is affirmed [68]. In W’s 
case, the High Court’s order is restored since assault occasioning actual bodily harm may be a serious 
offence and it was appropria te to include it within the category of offences requiring disclosure [69].   
Lady Hale  agrees with Lord Sumption that, given the changes to the statutory schemes in 2014, the  
legality test  is satisfied  [72-73]. She considers that the law in question does  not have to contain an 
individual review mechanism in every case. The requirement is only that it is possible to test, both the law itself  and the decisions  made  under it, for  proportionality  [73] . The  present  schemes  are not 
indiscriminate  in nature  and have been  carefully  devised  to balance  the competing  public  interests  in 
(1) rehabilitation,  (2) safeguarding  and (3) practicability [75]. Given  the need  for a practicable  and 
proportionate scheme, bright-line rules are necessary [76-77]. She agrees with Lord Sumption that the  
categories  used  are proportionate,  save  as to the two  exceptions  above,  and accordingly  agrees  with 
him on the disposal of each appeal and the cross-appeal [78- 79].
Lord Kerr’s minority judgment: 
Lord Kerr would have dismissed the appeals (including in W’s case)  and affirme d the declarations of 
incompatibility made by the EWCA and NICA. Lord Kerr disagrees with the majority on compliance 
with the legality test and the proportionality test. He illustrates the issues with the current statutory 
schemes by reference to a fuller account of the circumstances of each of the respondents 
[80-100] . He also reviews in detail the operation of the two statutory schemes before and after the 2014 
amendments [101-146] . 
Lord  Kerr con siders  that two important  points  follow from  the Supreme  Court’s  decision  in R (T). 
These are: (1) that there must be adequate safeguards built into a disclosure scheme which allow for a 
proper evaluation of proportionality and (2) that the provisions then in force were condemned for the 
lack of any mechanism for independent review [149] . Lord Kerr identifies five central precepts that are 
relevant to the legality test [153, 158] , but adds that not all of these must necessarily be satisfied [159] .      
He considers  that the fundamental  requirement  is that the operation  of the safeguards  must  permit a 
proper  assessment  of the  proportionality  of the interference  with  the Article  8 ECHR  right [159] . 
He also clarifies that his approach to the legality test goes beyond only satisfying the two requirements 
of accessibility and foreseeability, contrary to Lord Sumption’s approach [182-187] . 
Lord Kerr would have found the scheme  in England and Wales to fail the legality test  since the cases 
show that there is at least the potential for widespread disproportionate outcomes in disclosure [162] . 
Therefore,  it cannot  be said  that there are  safeguards  adequately  to examine  proportionality  [162] . 
He suggests  two potential  modifications:  (1) a provision  which  linked  the relevance  of the data  to be 
disclosed to the nature of the employment sought [165-173]  and (2) an individual review mechanism in 
some cases, such as that introduced in Northern Ireland in 2016 [174-175] . Further, Lord Kerr would 
have found the scheme disproportionate [188-190] .

REASONS FOR THE JUDGM ENT  
 
In the previous case of  R (Adams ) v Secretary of State for Justice [2011] UKSC 18 , the Supreme Court  
identified four categories of case, of progressively wider scope , as a framework for discussing the 
meaning of “miscarriage of justice”  for which an applicant could be compensated  in accordance with 
section 133 : (i) where the fresh evidence shows clearly that the defendant is innocent of the crime of 
which he had been convicted; (ii) where the fresh evidence so undermines the evidence aga inst the 
defendant that no conviction could possibly be based upon it; (iii) where the conviction rendered the 
conviction unsafe because, had it been available at the time of trial, a reasonable jury might or might not 
have convicted; (iv) where something had gone seriously wrong in the investigation of the offence or 
the conduct of the trial, resulting in the conviction of somebody who should not have been convicted. 
The Court  held that categories (i) and (ii) fell within the meaning of the phrase “miscarr iage of justice” , 
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P  3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 and that section 133  was compatible with Article 6(2) , which provides that everyone charged with a 
criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.  
 
The appeal thus oblige s the Supreme Court to consider w hether it should depart from its previous 
decision in Adams in the light of the decision in  Allen  v United Kingdom , where the European Court of 
Human Rights (“ ECtHR ”) held that an applicant’s Article 6(2) right was not violated in a category (iii) 
case, and in the light of the introduction of section 133(1ZA) , which defined “miscarriage of justice” so 
as to limit the entitlement to compensation to category (i) cases.  
 
Lord Mance holds that whether there exists a link between the criminal charge and, for ins tance, civil 
proceedings arising from the same facts is a diversion from the real question, namely whether the court 
in addressing the other, civil claim has suggested that the criminal proceedings should have been 
determined differently. If it has, it has  exceeded  its role. [47] Lord Mance would refuse to depart from 
Adams  or follow the case law of the ECtHR if and insofar as the ECtHR  may have , in the past , gone 
further than this. [48] 
 
Even if that is wrong and  article 6(2) is in fact engaged, a separate question arises of whether section 
133(1ZA) is nevertheless compatible with the Convention  because it confines compensation to cases 
where the newly discovered evidence shows beyond doubt that the defendant did not commit the 
offence . This question has never been directly before the ECtHR or decided by it, and Lord Mance is 
far from confident that the Court would conclude that section 133(1ZA) is incompatible if the question 
were argued before it. [61]  
 
Although it is in general wise fo r the Supreme Court to find that an applicant’s rights have been breached 
where it is clear that the ECtHR would find a violation of the Convention, Lady Hale is persuaded that 
it is not so clear in this case. [76] Her Ladyship agrees with Lord Reed that article 6(2) is engaged, but it 
does not follow that the ECtHR would automatically find a violation. She also agrees with Lord Mance ’s 
formulation of the test . [78] Lady Hale also considers the ECtHR’s jurisprudence in this area to be 
evolving [79] and it is not appropriate for the court to make a declaration of incompatibility in 
proceedings brought by an individual in respect of whom the ECtHR would be unlikely to find a 
violation (the facts of these cases being equ ivalent to those in Allen where no violation was found).  [81]-
[82] 
 
Lord Wilson would dismiss the appeal on the basis that the ECtHR’s case -law on article 6(2) has become 
hopelessly confused.  [85] Lord Wilson cannot subscribe to the ECtHR’s analysis in thi s area, despite 
the high professional regard in which he holds its judges, the desirability of a uniform interpretation of 
article 6(2) through out the states of the Council of Europe, his belief that there is no  room left for 
further constructive dialogue between this court and the ECtHR, and his recognition that the appellants 
are likely to prevail before the ECtHR in establishing a violation of their Convention rights. [94] 
 
Lord Hughes would dismiss the appeals for reasons which substantially , although not explicitly , overlap 
with those of both Lord Mance and Lord Wilson. [127] Different legal systems adopt different 
compensation schemes for those wrongfully convicted and, in some jurisdictions, even for those who 
were detained pending their tr ial. The ECtHR has been at pains to say that neither article 6(2) nor any 
other rule provides an unqualified right to be compensated in such circumstances. A person who seeks 
compensation after their conviction has been quashed is merely seeking to bring h imself within the 
legitimate restrictive eligibility requirements for such compensation. Thus, even  if there existed a 
workable test for  finding  the requisite “link” between an earlier (eventually quashed) conviction and the 
later compensation proceedings,  such a link would not exist  in this case,  because the latter can only be 
said to be based on the former to the extent that the first condition for eligibility for compensation is 
that a conviction has been quashed. [123] -[124]  
 
Lord Lloyd -Jones agrees wi th Lord Mance  and attaches particular importance to the fact that the ECtHR 
has not yet directly addressed the issue of why it is objectionable to require evidence establishing 
innocence but it is not objectionable to require evidence establishing that the  claimant could not 
reasonably have been convicted. Having regard to the unsettled state of the ECtHR’s case law, Lord  
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P  3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Lloyd -Jones is not persuaded that section 133 is incompatible with the Convention . These matters 
require consideration by the ECtHR. [137]-[138]  
 
Lord Reed would have allowed the appeal . The critical factors (identified by  the ECtHR in Allen ) in 
establishing the necessary link are that the quashing of the conviction is a prerequisite of proceedings 
under section 133 and that in order to  arrive at a decision on the claim it is necessary for the Secretary 
of State to examine the judgment of the Court of Appeal to determine whether the criteria of section 
133 were satisfied. [170] Whilst it may be appropriate for this Court to decline to follow the ECtHR in 
certain circumstances, no circumstances of that kind exist  here: the Grand Chamber’s judgment in Allen 
was carefully considered, is based on a detailed analysis of the relevant case law, is consistent with a line 
of authority going back d ecades , and has  been followed by the ECtHR subsequently . [174] In the 
absence of some compelling justification, Lord Reed finds it difficult to accept that this court should 
deliberately adopt a construction of the Convention which it knows to be out of st ep with the ECtHR’s 
approach, established by numerous judgments, and confirmed at the level of the Grand Chamber. [175] 
Lord Reed accepts that the implication of the decision in Allen is that it is not necessarily incompatible 
with article 6(2) to refuse c ompensation under section 133 in in category (iii) cases, but  holds that section 
133(1ZA) is not compatible with article 6(2), because  it effectively requires the Secretary of State to 
decide whether persons whose convictions are quashed have established t hat they are innocent. [187]  
 
Lord Kerr  agrees with Lord Reed. For the reasons given by Lord Reed, Lord Kerr considers that there 
exists the requisite link between the concluded criminal proceedings and the compensation proceedings , 
which is the test articulated in  a clear and constant line of Strasbourg jurisprudence. [205]  His Lordship 
also rejects Lord Mance’s formulation of the relevant test because it would cut out a swathe of deserving 
applicants who are  unable to prove their innocence even thoug h they are , in fact, innocent and  the fate 
of applicants  would be determined by the phraseology that happened to be chosen by the court . [206]

The Supreme Court dismisses Mastercard ’s appeal . It agrees w ith the Court of Appeal  that the CAT ’s 
decision is undermined by error of law and sends Mr Merricks ’ applicatio n for a CPO back  to the CAT. 
Lord Briggs  gives the main  judgment, with which  Lord Thomas agree s. Lord Kerr  had agreed that the 
appeal should be dismissed for  the reasons set out in Lord Briggs ’ judgment  prior to his retirement on 
30 September 2020 .  
 Three days before  the judgment  was initially  due to be handed d own, Lord Kerr sadly died. The President 
of the Supreme Court re -constitute d the panel  unde r section 43(4) of the Constitution al Reform Act 
2005 to consist of Lord Briggs, Lord Sales, Lord Leggatt and Lor d Thom as.  
 Lord Sales and Lord Leggatt give a combined separa te judgment  in which they disagree with Lord Briggs’  
reasoning in part . They do not dissent  as they recognise that they were in the minority  and the pure 
happenstance  that Lord Kerr  died after completi on of the judgments , but just before they could be 
handed down,  should not mean t hat the case  has to be re -heard due to an evenly divided pa nel [82-83].  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 Collective pro ceedings are a special f orm of civil procedure . They are designed t o provide  access  to 
justic e and ensure the vindi cation of privat e rights  where an ordinary  indivi dual civil c laim would be  
inadequate for that purpose . This purpose helps interpret the legal requirements of the ce rtification 
process  [45]. 
 An import ant element of the back ground to collective proceedings  is that courts frequently have to  deal 
with difficul t issues in calc ulating damages . Courts do not  deprive an individu al claimant of a trial  merely 
because of these  quant ificati on issues , provided there is a triable issue t hat the claimant  has suffered 
more than nominal loss [46-47].  If these  issues would not have prevent ed an individual consumer ’s 
claim from proceeding  to trial, the CAT  should not have stop ped the collective pr oceedings  claim at the 
certifi cation phase [ 56]. This fundament al requirement of justice that the court must do its best on the 
available evidence in relation to damages is  the “broad axe ” principle  and it applie s to competition cases 
[51]. Justice require s that damage s be quant ified in order to vindi cate a claimant ’s rights and to ensure 
that a defendant pay s to reflect the wrong don e, especially where anti -competitive conduct may nev er 
otherwise  be restrained i f indiv idual consumers a re unabl e to b ring cl aims [ 53-54].  
 Anot her import ant element is  to understand the  meaning of “suitable”, both under s ection 47B(6) of 
the Act  which requires the claims to be “ suitable ” to be brought in collective proceedings, and in rule 
79(2)(f) which says that  they must be  “suitable ” for an aggregate award of damages.  “Suitable ” means 
suitable  relative to individua l proceedin gs. Therefore, the  CAT should have asked itself whether  the claims 
were suitable to be brought in collective proceedings as compar ed to  individu al proc eedings, and suitabl e 
for an a ward of aggregat e damages as compared to  individ ual damages  [56-57].  
 Against this background, the Supreme Court finds that the CAT made five erro rs of law  [64]. First, it 
failed to recognise that  in addi tion to overch arge, the mer chant p ass-on issue was also a common is sue 
(as the Court of Appeal h ad found and which was not app ealed to the S upreme Court ). This should have 
been a powerfu l factor in favour of certification (rul e 79(2)(a) of the C AT Rules) [ 66]. Sec ond, t he CAT 
placed great weight on its dec ision that the c ase was not suitable for aggregate damages. This  is a relevant 
factor  for certificati on, but it is not a condition [61, 67-69]. Third , the CAT should have applied a test 
of relative suitabi lity. If the forensic  difficulties  would have been insufficient to deny a trial to an 
individual cl aimant, they s hould not hav e been sufficient to deny certification for collective proceedings  
[70-71]. Fourth  (the most serious error), the CAT was wrong to consider  that difficu lties with incomplet e 
data and  interpreting  the data are a good reason to refu se certifi cation . Civil cou rts and  tribunals 
frequent ly face problems with quantifying loss and the CAT owes a duty to the class to carry out the 
task in a c ase of proven breach of statutory duty coupl ed with  a realistically  arguable  case that some loss 
was suffered [72-74]. Fift h, the CAT was wrong to require Mr Merricks ’ proposed method of  distributing 
aggrega te damages to take account of  the loss suffered by each c lass m ember . A central pur pose of the 
power  to award aggreg ate damages in collective procee dings is to avoi d the need for individual The Supreme Court of  the Unit ed Kingdo m 
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/ 1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.s upremecourt.uk  
 assessment of lo ss and t he Act expressly modifies the ordinary requirement for the separate assessment 
of each clai mant ’s loss [58, 77].  
 
Lord Sales  and Lord Leggatt  agree with Lord  Briggs  that the CAT  was wrong to refuse cert ification on 
the distribution issue  [148-150]. However, t hey disagree  on the suitability for aggregate damages issue . 
They consider that the CAT applied  the t est to determine the  suitabili ty of a class of claims  for an 
aggregate award of damages under section  47C(2) of the Act  correctly  and thus the CAT was entitled to 
conclude t hat the claims were not suitable to be brought in collective pr oceedings [167-169]. Their ke y 
reason s are at [111 , 116-119, 121, 124, 153, 156-166].

 The Supreme Court unanimously  dismisses the appeal. Lord Reed gives the sole judgment, with which 
the other Justices agree.  
  REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 Section 51 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 provides that the High Court and the Court of Appeal  have 
discretion as to the award of costs, subject to the rules of court  [21]-[22]. The rules of court include  the 
general rule that, if the court decides to make an order about costs, the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party [23]. The rules of court do not, however, set out a comprehensive 
code [24]. It is also important  that the appellate courts establish principles upon whic h the courts’ 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 discretion as to the award of costs may, within the framework of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and the 
rules of court, be exercised [24] . Responsibility for the development of those  principles falls principally 
upon the Court of Appeal [24] . Generally , such principles are  matters of practice, rather than matters of 
law [24] . 
 The Supreme Court will ordinarily be  slow to intervene in matters of practice , including guidance given 
by the Court of Appeal as to the practice to be followed by lower c ourts in relation to the award of costs 
[36]. This is because the  Supreme Court is generally less well placed to assess what changes in practice 
can appropriately be made [36] . The Supreme Court can  intervene where there has been an error of law , 
but, bearing in mind the discretionary nature of decisions on costs, and the rarity of their raising any 
question of law of general public importance, appeals solely on costs are not ordinarily appropriate  [36].  
 The counterpart  of this restraint  on the part o f the Supreme Court is that  the Court of Appeal must fulfil 
its primary responsibility for monitoring and controlling developments in practice [37] . In order to fulfil 
that responsibility, decisions on matters of practice should not  be treated as binding p recedents  [37]. 
Otherwise,  any departure from a previous decision could only be brought about by an appeal to the 
Supreme Court [37] , and the Court of Appeal would be unable  to respond flexibly to unusual situations, 
and reach a just result in each individual case [38] . Instead, it is appropriate for decisions of the Court 
of Appeal  on matters of practice to be  open to review  by the Court of Appeal  itself [39]. To avoid 
repeated arguments, potentially divergent decisions, and the attendant risk of inconsistency and incoherence, such decisions should be reviewed  only where there is sufficient reason to do so: for 
example, where there has been a material change of circumstances [40] . 
 In the present case,  the High Court took full account of the arguments made on behalf of Mr Gourlay , 
and reached a decision which reflected established practice  [44]. The  question of whether the Parole 
Board falls within the scope of the practice described in Davies is itself  a matter of practice: it is not 
determined abstractly or on the basis of definitions used for other purposes, such as the meaning given to the expression “court or tribunal” in the European Convention on Human Rights [44] . There is 
nothing in the Judge’s reasoning which was erroneous in law, or with which the Supreme Court would consider it appropriate to interfere as a matter of practice [44] . 
 The Court of Appeal  also did not commit  any error of law  [45]. In particular, its  approach was not 
inconsistent with the rules of court  [46] . The choice of a judicial or quasi -judicial body  to take a neutral 
position in court proceedings accords with  principles of judicial independence and impartiality, and this 
cannot be what the framers of the rules of court  had in mind when they referred to an unsuccessful party  
[46]. In addition, the Court of Appeal correctly  recognised that the fact that a party is in receipt of legal 
aid cannot affect the principles on which the discretion to award costs is normally exercised  [47]-[48]. 
It also did not incorrectly treat itself as bound, as a matter of precedent, to follow the  decision in Davies  
[42], [45]. The Court  of Appeal could have proceeded on the basis that there was no good reason to 
review its recent decisions on this issue [42] , [45]. Nonetheless, the Court  considered Mr Gourlay’s 
submissions in full and gave detailed reasons for rejecting them on their merits [42] , [45]. Insofar as the 
decision whether to award costs against the Parole Board turns on matters of practice, it would not be  
appropriate for the Supreme Court  to impose on the  Court of Appeal its own assessment of the merits 
of the parties’ arguments [49] . Mr Gourlay’s  appeal  must therefore be dismissed [50] .

The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 Lord Kitchin  holds that Non -Negs are neither  “stakes staked” , nor have any value in money or money’s 
worth within the meaning of section 11(10)(a) of the FA [31 -48].  
 First, the assessment of the gross gaming yield from  any premises requires a focus on the activity of 
gaming and not the provision of other goods or services  [36]. Second, the  assessment required by section 
11(10)  must be  carried out from  the banker’s perspective , for it is the banker’s profits which must be 
brought into account in calculating the gross gaming yield [37] . Third, the reference to “ money or money’s 
worth” in section 11(10)(a) emphasises that it is the real world value of the stakes in the hands of the 
banker which matters  [38].   
 A gambler who plays with cash chips in a casino is not staking the chips as such but the money those 
chips represent , which the gambler  has deposited with the casino [31-35]. That is not the case when a 
gambler places a bet using a Non- Neg, which essentially amounts to a free bet. Therefore , a Non -Neg 
holds no real world value to the casino when a gambler loses it in a bet , save that it eliminates the chance 
that the casino may  have to pay out the winnings corresponding to that bet . However, that d oes not 
impart a “ value, in money or money’s worth ” to the Non -Neg, nor mean that it is a “ stake staked” within the 
meaning of section 11(10)(a) of the FA  [44] .     
 Lord Sales agrees with Lord Kitchin’s reasoning in this regard and provides further reasons in support of the conclusion [88 -92]. 
 Lady Arden adopts different reasoning for dismissing the appeal  [61-78]. She holds that  the “ value” of a 
stake for the purposes of  section 11(10)(a) is what a person would pay for it in the open market [62] . 
The objective valuation of the stake means that it  can be taken into account at an appropriate value if it 
has generated gaming activity, which is what gaming duty is charged upon [70] . A Non-Neg is a stake  
for the purposes of  assessing the banker’s profits under section 11(10)(a) of the FA  [75]. However, the 
appeal fails on the facts of this case as  no evidence  was adduced  to support any objective valuation [68]. 
 The Supreme Court also consider s the related issue of what value , if any , should be given to Non- Negs 
for the purposes of section 11(10)(b)  of the FA. Lord Kitchin expresses the view  that, as with section 
11(10)(a), it is the real world cost to the banker o f providing the prizes that must be brought into account  
for the purposes of assessing  the value of the prizes provided by the banker , subject to the relevant 
provisions of the BDGA  [38]. Under the BGDA, the cost to the banker of awarding a voucher as a 
prize is taken to be its face value if, among other things, it may be used in place of money as whole or partial payment for benefits of a specified kind obtained from a specified person. No n-Negs do not 
satisfy  this condition and must therefore be treated as having no value for the purposes of section 
11(10)(b)  of the FA  [54]. Lord Kitchin is confirmed in his views by the consideration that the result is  
a coherent scheme for the treatment o f Non -Negs , whether used by gamblers to place bets or when 
returned to gamblers as prizes [56] .  
 Lord Sales reaches a different conclusion from  the majority in this regard.  When a Non -Neg is awarded 
as a prize , it represents a real cost to the banker which ought to be brought into account [93] . A Non -
Neg given as a prize satisfies the relevant conditions under the BDGA  1981,  such that it should normally 
be treated as having its face value for the purpose s of section 11(10)(b) of the FA [95 -104]. Lady Arden 
agrees with Lord Sales’s conclusion in this regard [82 -84].

 The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal . It holds, for reasons which differ in part from 
courts below, that as  at the date of the hearing to remove Mr Rokison, the fair -minded and informed 
observer  would not conclude that circumstances existed that gave rise to justifiable doubts about Mr 
Rokison’s impartiality. Lord Hodge gives the  leading  judgment with whom Lord Reed, Lady Black and 
Lord Lloyd -Jones agree. Lady Arden gives a concurring judgment.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 The law  
 The duty of impartiality is a core principle of arbitration law  [49]. In English law, the duty applies equally 
to party -appointed arbitrators and independently appointed arbitrators [63] . In considering  an allegation 
of apparent bias  against an arbitrator , the tes t is whether the fair -minded and informed observer would 
conclude there is a real possibility of bias [52, 55] . The courts will apply that objective test, having regard 
to the particular characteristics of international arbitration , including  the private n ature of most 
arbitrations [56 -68].  
 The duty of disclosure is not simply  good arbitral practice but is a legal duty in English law. It is a 
component of the arbitrator’s statutory obligations of fairness and impartiality [78] . The legal duty of 
disclosure does not , however,  override the arbitrator’s duty of privacy and confidentiality in English law.  
Where information which needs to be disclosed is subj ect to a duty of confidentiality, disclosure can 
only be made if the parties owed confidentiality obligations give their consent. Such consent may be 
express but may also be inferred from the arbitration agreement itself  in the context of the custom and 
practice in the relevant field of arbitration  [88-104]. The arbitrator’s duty of disclosure is to disclose 
matters which might reasonably give rise to justifiable doubts as to his or her impartiality [107 -116]. A 
failure to disclose relevant matters is a factor for the fair -minded and informed observer to take into 
account in assessing whether there is a real possibility of bias[117 -118]. 
 In assessing whether an arbitrator has failed in a duty to make disclosu re, the fair -minded and informed 
observer will have regard to the facts and circumstances as at  and from  the time the duty arose [119 -
120]. In contrast, i n assessing whether there is a real possibility that an arbitrator is biased, the fair -
minded and informed observer will have regard to the facts and circumstances known at the time of the hearing to remove the arbitrator  [121- 123].  
 The issues in this appeal   There may be circumstances  where the acceptance of multiple appointments involving a common party 
and the same or overlapping subject matter gives rise to an appearance of bias . Whether it does so will 
depend on the facts of the case  and, in particular,  the customs and practice in the relevant field of 
arbitration [127-131]. Where, as in t he context of a Bermuda Form arbitration, the  circumstances might 
reasonably give rise to a conclusion that there was a real possibility of bias, the arbitrator is under a legal duty to disclose such  appointments  unless the parties to arbitration  have agre ed otherwise  [132 -136].  
 Applying those conclusions to the facts, Mr Rokison was under a legal duty to disclose  his appointment 
in the subsequent reference involving Chubb and Transocean. At the time of his appointment, the existence of potentially overlapping arbitrations with only one common party, Chubb, might reasonably have given rise to a real possibility of bias [145] . In failing to make that disclosure Mr Rokison breached 
his duty of disclosure [147] .  
 However, having regard to the circumstances known at  the date of the hearing at first instance, it could 
not be said that the fair -minded and informed observer would infer from Mr Rokison’s failure to make 
disclosure  that there was a real possibility of bi as. At the time, it had not been clear that there was a legal The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 duty of disclosure. Secondly, the Transocean arbitrations had commenced several months  after the 
Halliburton arbitration. Thirdly, Mr Rokison’s measured response to Halliburton’s challenge explained  
that it was likely the subsequent references would be resolved by a preliminary issue  (as they in fact were)  
and that, if they were not, he would consider resigning from the Transocean arbitrations. There was 
therefore no likelihood of Chubb gaining a ny advantage by reason of overlapping references. Fourthly, 
there was no question of his having received any secret financial benefit, and, fifthly, there was no basis for inferring any unconscious ill will on his part. As a result, Halliburton’s appeal fa ils [149 -150].    
 Lady Arden’s concurring judgment  
 Lady Arden agrees with Lord Hodge ’s judgment  but makes a few further points to reinforce or, in some 
instances, qualify the conclusions reache d. The duty of disclosure is a secondary obligation arising from 
the arbitrator’s primary duty to act fairly and impartially [160] . Unless the arbitration is one where there 
is an accepted practice of dispensing with  the need to obtain parties’ consent to further appointments, 
the arbitrator should proceed on the basis that  a proposed further appointment involving a common 
party and overlapping subject matter is likely to require disclosure  of a possible conflict of interest  [164] . 
The duty of disclosure is rooted in the duty of imp artiality  but is also an implied  (if not express) term of 
the arbitrator’s appointment [167] . The parties can therefore agree to waive any objection to a conflict 
of interest,  but disclosure is only an option if the conflict is one which would not prevent the arbitrator 
from acting impartially [168, 170] . Confidentiality is an important  and free -standing  implied term [173-
175]. But, in general, high -level disclosure about a proposed appointment in a further arbitration can be 
made without any breach of confidentiality by naming only the common party (who may be taken to have consented to disclosure) but not the other parties to the arbitration [183-187].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal, but for differing reasons. The majority (Lord Reed, Lord 
Hodge, Lord Lloyd- Jones and Lord Hamblen) hold that section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980  applies 
to claims for the restitution of money paid under a mistake of law, with time beginning to run when the 
claimant discovers or could with reasonable diligence have discovered their mistake in the sense of 
recognising that they have a worthwhile claim. It leaves the application of that test to the facts of this case 
for the High Court, after the parties have had an opportunity to amend their pleadings.  The minority (Lord  
Carnwath, Lord Briggs and Lord Sales) would have held that section 32(1)(c) has no application to mistakes of law.  
 
Lord Reed and Lord Hodge give the main judgment, with which Lord Lloyd- Jones and Lord Hamblen agree.  
Lord Briggs and Lord Sales give a partially dissenting judgment, with which Lord Carnwath agrees.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 Should HMRC be allowed to argue that section 32(1)(c) does not apply  to mistakes of law?  
 
The Court rejects the Test Claimants’ various objections to HMRC arguing at this stage of the proceedings  
that section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980 does not apply to mistakes of law.  
 “Cause of action estoppel” is a legal doctrine which stops  a party from raising points which might have been 
but were not raised and decided in earlier proceedings [61] -[62]. As it operates  only to prevent the raising of 
points which were essential to the existence or non- existence of a cause of action, and the effect of limitation 
instead is to render an otherwise valid claim unenforceable, this doctrine does not prevent HMRC from 
making their current challenge [63] .  
 
“Issue estoppel” is a related legal doctrine which stops  a party from raising points which were not raised in 
earlier proceedings or were raised unsuccessfully [64]-[68] . As the question of when the limitation period 
commenced was not argued or determined in the first  phase of the FII Group Litigation, and as it would not 
have been possible for HMRC to make their current limitation challenge before the lower courts, this 
doctrine does not prevent HMRC from making that challenge now  [69] .  
 
Further, HMR C’s challenge does not amount to an abuse of process, when seen in  the context of  group 
litigation which raises novel issues of unparalleled complexity, and which was the subject of case management 
decisions as to the order in which these issues were to be addressed [78]-[79] . It is readily understandable 
why in the first phase of the litigation HMRC focused on arguments which, if successful, would have made 
it unnecessary to mount this wider challenge [80 ].  
 
On the basis of those factors, as well as the substantial value of the claims, the importance of the issue to 
other claimants both within and outside the FII Group Litigation, and the potential to remedy any prejudice 
through an order for costs, the Supreme Court allows HMRC to withdraw their concession that section 
32(1)(c) applies to mistakes of law, and now to make the contrary case [94]-[100]. That case places in question 
two of the most important decisions on the law of limitation of recent times : Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group 
Plc v Inland Revenue Comrs  [2006] UKHL 49 (“ Deutsche Morgan Grenfell ”) and  Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln 
City Council [1999] 2 AC 349 (“ Kleinwort Benson ”) [1] , [172] . 
 What is the test for  the discoverability  of a mistake  under section 32(1)(c)?  
 
In Deutsche Morgan Grenfell , the House of Lords tied the date of discoverability of a mistake of law to the date 
when “the truth” as to whether the claimant has a well- founded cause of action is established by a  decision 
of a court of final jurisdiction [167] -[170] , [213] . Section 32(1)(c) cannot be intended to have that effect, as The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 limitation periods apply regardless of whether the substance of the claim is disputed, and regardless of 
whether there is in truth a well- founded cause of action [177] -[179] , [199]-[202] , [213]. Such an approach 
also has the illogical consequence that mistakes are not discoverable by a claimant until after he has issued a 
claim on the basis of the mistake [173] -[174] , and perpetuates the problems associated with distinguishing 
between matters of fact and matters of law [195] , [213] , [250] .  
 Given those very unfortunate consequences, for which there is currently no prospect of Parliament enacting 
a legislative solution,  it is appropriate for the Supreme Court  to depart from the decision in Deutsche Morgan 
Grenfell in relation to discoverability [250] -[253] . The correct approach is that time begins  to run under 
section 32(1)(c) when the claimant discovers, or could with reasonable diligence discover, his mistake in the 
sense of recognising that a worthwhile claim arises [193] , [209] . That approach brings section 32(1)(c) into 
line with section 32(1)(a), and with other analogous provisions of the 1980 Act [180] -[196], [213]. 
 
Does section 32(1)(c) apply to mistakes of law?  
 
Section 32(1)(c) applies to mistakes of law, as the House of Lords decided in Kleinwort Benson. Although that 
decision was not supported by convincing reasoning [148] -[161] , and although when section 32(1)(c) was 
enacted it was not contemplated that it might extend to actions for the restitution of money paid under a mistake of law, the ordinary meaning of the words of that provision include such actions [220 ]-[221], [242] -
[243] . Excluding claims based on a mistake of law would frustrate the purpose of section 32(1)(c), which is 
to relieve claimants from the necessity of complying with a time limit at a time when they cannot reasonably 
be expected to do so [220] -[221] , [242] -[243] . Including such claims does not have unacceptable 
consequences for legal certainty, particularly now that the approach to discoverability in Deutsche Morgan 
Grenfell  is departed from  [225] -[229] , [242] -[243] . 
 
How should the  test for discoverability of a mistake under section 32(1)(c) be applied to the facts of this case?  
 
The Court of Appeal applied the approach to discoverability  wrongly established in Deutsche Morgan Grenfell , 
such that HMRC’s appeal must be allowed [254] . The Supreme Court cann ot, however, determine  in the 
abstract  the point in time when the Test Claimants could with reasonable diligence have discovered their 
mistake. That question is left for the High Court to determine, after the parties have had an opportunity to 
amend their pleadings [255] . 
 
Dissenting judgment  
 
In their partially dissenting judgment, Lord Briggs and Lord Sales conclude that section 32(1)(c) does not 
apply to payments made on the basis of a mistake of law [258] . They consider that the House of Lords was 
wrong to decide otherwise in Kleinwort Benson [274]-[285 ] and that the proper course now is to overrule that 
decision [298] , [303] . Any application of section 32(1)(c) to mistakes of law which include judicial rewriting 
of the law is bound to risk opening up very old claims [289]  across a wide range of cases [293] , going well 
beyond the narrow equitable principle which was intended to apply [296] . This introduces large inroads into  
the overall purpose of the legislation by undermining legal certainty [259] . The approach taken by the 
majority  to the issue of discoverability does not  provide an  adequate  answer to these objections [278] , [297]  
and could prove unfair and unworkable in practice [259] , [298] . On the footing that the majority’s  
interpretation of section 32(1)(c) has prevailed,  however, Lord Briggs and Lord Sales agree that it is  
appropriate to depart from the decision in Deutsche Morgan Grenfell  in relation to discoverability [304] .

The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
 
Lady Arden explains that neither the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (“ the Act ”) nor the European 
Convention on Human Rights requires any particular standard  of proof for conclusions at an inquest  
[2,12]. There was case law to the effect that conclusions of suicide and unlawful killing should be reached 
on the criminal standard [ 60, 70].  A coroner’s inquest is not , however,  a criminal proceeding [2].  The 
Coroners (Inquests) Rules 2013 (“ the Rules ”) contain a form  which must be used to record the result 
of an inquest  [15]. Note (iii) to th is form explains  that the standard of proof for short form conclusions 
of suicide and unlawful killing is the criminal standard and that for other conclusions the  civil standard 
applies [16]. Adopting Wilson LJ ’s reasoning  in R (LG) v Independent Appeal Panel for Tom Hood  School 
[2010] EWCA Civ 142; [2010] PTSR 1462 Lady Arden holds that the Rules could pr escribe  standard of 
proof.  The issue is whether the effect of Note (iii)  is to require a particular standard . 
 
The Ministry of Justice (“ the MoJ ”) consulted on the Rules in draft  [24] . The MoJ ’s response 
document explain ed that case law had established the standard of proof and the Rules could not 
change the law  [26-27]. Lady Arden holds  that that response is relevant to interpreting Note (iii) and 
shows that Parliament did not intend to change or codify the law as it understood it to be  [42] . A 
footnote can la y down a new legal rule ( Hunt v R M Douglas (Roofing ) [1990] 1 AC 398) but the 
circumstances of that case were very different [43].  The contrary result in this case would contravene 
the drafting conventions on which our unwritten constitution depends [44].  On its true interpretation, 
Note (iii) did not take away the power of the courts to develop the common law  [56] .  
 Lady Arden concl udes that, consistently  with  legal principle , the civil standard of proof applies  to short 
form conclusions  of suicide  [68] . The previous case law is not binding on the Supreme Court and does 
not identify a good reason against applying the civil standard [70]. To apply different standards of proof 
for short form and narrative conclusions leads to an internally inconsistent system of fact -finding  [71]. 
If a criminal standard of proof is required, suicide is likely to be under -recorded  [73-74]. Societal 
attitudes  to suicide  have changed  and the role of inquests has developed to be concerned with the 
investigation of deaths, not criminal justice [75-81]. Also, certain Commonwealth jurisdictions have 
aligned the standard of proof applicable in inquests with the standard applicable in civil proceedings [82]. 
 Lady Arden  holds that the civil standard of proof  also appl ies to determinations of unlawful killing  
[93],[96]. There is  then consistency between the determinations made at a n inquest [96] .  
 
In his concurring judgment, Lord Carnwath considers that the Act does not indicate that the civil 
standard of proof cannot apply a conclusion of suicide  [100] . In his view, Note  (iii) does not have that 
effect.  The public consultation materials  confirm th at position [107] .  
 
Lord Kerr i n his dissenting judgment holds that the criminal standard of proof applies  to short form 
conclusions  of suicide and unlawful killing  [143] . There  is no inconsistency caused by a short form and 
narrative conclusion having different standards of proof [ 116]. There is nothing untoward in putting 
suicide and unlawful killing in a special category of verdicts that require proof to the criminal standard [139] . Note (iii) to the form did not attempt to change the law, but confirmed what the existing law was. 
As a result, the common law rule  became a statutory rule  [125] . It can only cease to have effect if 
Parliament enacts a statutory provision to amend or abolish it [126] . The Rules unquestionably 
established a statutory basis for the application of the criminal standard of proof for short form 
conclusions of suicide and  unlawful killing [132]. Lord Reed agrees with Lord Kerr.

 The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal, though for different reasons to  those given by 
the Court of Appeal . Lord Burrows writes the judgment . The application to modify the restrictive 
covenants is refused.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 Section 84 of the 1925 Act, as amended, confers upon the UT  the power to discharge or modify 
restrictive covenants on five grounds. The exercise of this  power has two stages . At least one of the  
grounds must be satisfied (the “ jurisdictional stage ”) before the UT can then decide whether to 
exercise its discretion  to discharge or modify the restrictive covenants (the “ discretionary stage”) . The 
ground relevant to this appeal is  whether  the restricti ve covenants , by impeding a reasonable user of 
land, are  contrary to the public interest : sections 84(1)(aa) and 84(1A )(b) [31-33].  
 The first  issue is  whether Millgate’s deliberate and cynical breach of the restrictive covenants  is relevant  
at the jurisdictional stage [41]. The Court of Appeal found that it was [47] . The Supreme  Court finds 
that it is not. The “ contrary to the public interest ” ground requires a narrow interpretation.  Its focus is 
on the impeding of a reasonable user of the land and “whether that impediment,  by continuation of the restrictive 
covenant , is contrary  to the public interest ”. The question is not the wider one of “ whether in all the circumstances 
it would be contrary to the public interest to maintain the restrictive covenant ” [42].  
 This narrow interpretation requir es weighing the public interest in 13 affordable housing units not going 
to waste  against the public interest in the hospice providing a sanctuary for children dying of cancer . 
[43]. The good or bad conduct of the applicant is irrelevant at the  jurisdictional sta ge. It te lls us nothing 
about the merits of what the land  in question is being or will be used for [44] . This narrow interpretation  
is also in line  with the other four grounds under section 84 , accords with the purpose of section 84, and 
reflects  the fact that the applicant’s conduct can  still be considered at the discretionary  stage  [45] . 
 The second issue  is whether the UT failed properly to consider,  at the discretionary stage, Millgate’s 
cynical  conduct . The Court of Appeal found that it did [54] . The Supreme Court agrees, but for different 
reasons [53]. It is only appropriate for an appellate court to interfere in a discretionary decision of a 
specialist tribunal if that tribunal has made an error of law [51] . In this case, however, even though t he 
UT took into account Millgate’s conduct, it  did make  an error of law  [53]. The UT failed to consider 
two relevant factors  at the discretionary stage : (i) Millgate could have built on the unencumbered land, 
not the application land; and (ii) Millgate wou ld have been unlikely to satisf y the “contrary to the public 
interest ” ground had it applied to modify the restrictive covenants prior to building  on the application 
land. Millgate could not be rewarded for presenting the UT with a fait accompli [57 -62].  
 This is sufficient to dismiss the appeal. But , having heard full submissions on two further issues, the 
Court considers them briefly [63] . First, the UT did not rely on  Lord Sumption’s comments in Coventry 
v Lawrence  [2014] UKSC 13 and so any dispute about whether or not it had been correct to do so does  
not arise  [64-66]. Second, the UT correctly considered at both stage s the fact that Millgate had built on 
the application land in order to fulfil its affordable housing planning obl igations [70 -73]. 
 The Court therefore upholds the Court of Appeal’s decision, but for different reasons [74] . The UT’s 
decision is  re-made and the application to modify the restrictive covenants refused [77] .

 The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Servier’s appeal . It holds that the General Court findings 
Servier relies on are not binding in the domestic proceedings,  and declines to make a reference to the 
CJEU . Lord Lloyd- Jones gives the judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 The EU principle of absolute res judicata only applies to judicial decisions which have become definitive, 
either after all ri ghts of appeal have been exhausted or after the time limits for exercising those appeal 
rights  have expired.  The General Court’s findings are not yet definitive , and may never become 
definitive , because they may be reversed or rendered redundant in the appeal pending before the CJEU . 
The findings are not, therefore , binding in the  domestic  proceedings under the  EU principle of absolute 
res judicata. A  reference to the CJEU is unnecessary  to decide the issues in this case  [31-32].  
 The Court  nevertheless  sets out its views on the underlying issues of law, in the hope that they might 
assist at later stages of the  domestic  proceedings [32]. The leading authority on the EU principle of 
absolute res judicata is P&O European Ferries (Vizcaya) SA  and Diputación Foral de Vizcaya v Commission 
(Joined Cases C- 442/03P and C -471/03P) [2006] ECR I- 4845 [33-37]. This e xplains that, where the EU 
courts have annulled a Commission decision on substantive as opposed to procedural grounds, the 
substance of that judgment becomes binding  on all the world, not just on the parties. This ensures 
stability of legal relations, because it  means  that a matter which has been definitely settled by judicial 
decision cannot be referred to the courts by different parties for reconsideration [ 38].  
 The purpose of the EU principle of absolute res judicata is to prevent the annulling judgment from being 
called into qu estion in subsequent proceedings.  This purpose provides the key to the principle’s scope 
and applicability  [38, 42]. Absolute res judicata  gives dispositive effect to the judgment itself . It therefore 
extends to the  essential  reasons for the  judgment (or “ ratio decidendi ”), not just to the outcome set 
out in the operative part [39- 40]. Only those aspects of the judgment which explain why the Commission 
decision has been annulled form part of the ratio decidendi, because those are the aspects which must 
be respected to prevent the  annulling judgment from being called into question later on  [42]. 
 The General Court judgment annuls the Commission’s finding that Servier had infringed article 102 
TFEU , on the basis that  the Commission was wrong to conclude that the relevant product market was 
limited to Perindopril, as opposed to all ACE inhibitors. The General Court made a numb er of findings 
of fact in this regard, including those Servier relies on. Accordingly, i f the General Court judgment 
becomes definitive  and it c an be shown that the  relevant  findings were an essential basis of that 
judgment , it would not be possible to challenge th ose findings in later proceeding s which sought to 
contrad ict the General Court’s conclusions on the relevant product market within article 102 TFEU [4 6].  
 It is not necessary to treat the General Court’s findings as binding in any other legal context.  If the CJEU 
upholds the General Court  judgment that Servier did not infringe article 102 TFEU , the claimants will 
no longer pursue the ir article 102 claim. In an y case,  at present , the domestic proceedings do not  concern 
the relevant product marke t for the purposes of that article. Instead, Servier relies on the General Court’s 
findings to support its defence based on mitigation of loss flowing from alleged anti -competitive 
agreements contrary to article 101 TFEU. The General Court’s findings cannot be detached  from the 
authority of the annulling judgment  and deploy ed in this wholly different context  [48].  
 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Servier co ntends that the General Court’s findings are binding in any EU law proceedings which raise 
the same factual issues [4 7]. The Supreme Court rejects this argument  because it is not supported by the 
EU or domestic  case law [49- 60]. This is not surprising, because it would be  inconsistent with the 
purpose of the principle of absolute res judicata  [49].  
 
Servier’s proposed approach also raises practical difficulties  because it has no workable defined limits. 
More generally , if it is confined to the context of the  consequences of an annulling judgment, the 
principle of absolute res judicata promotes legal certainty, the effective judicial control of EU institutions 
and the maintenance of the EU legal order. However, once  freed from this restriction, it could operate 
in way that is  arbitrary and unjust, binding persons not party to the original dispute in a wholly different 
legal context in a way  which would be inconsistent with the principles of a fair trial [6 1].  
 The claimants’ claims in the domestic proceedings do not call into question or undermine the General 
Court judgment  or its consequences in any way, nor do they contradict the General Court’s decision as 
to what needs to be done to comply with EU law.  The Supreme Court is therefore satisfied to the 
standard of acte clair that the EU principle of absolute res judicata do es not apply [ 62].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Ms Henderson’s  appeal, and holds that her claim against Dorset 
Healthcare is barred by the illegality defence. Lord Hamblen gives the judgment, with which all members of 
the Court agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
 
Ms Henderson’s appeal raises three main issues [32 ]. 
 
Issue 1: Can Gray be distinguished?  
 
In Gray, the House of Lords held that Mr Gray’s negligence claim was barred by the defence of illegality 
because the damages he sought resulted from: (i) the sentence imposed on him by the criminal court; and/or 
(ii) his own criminal act of manslaughter [36 ]. The courts below held that the facts of Ms Henderson’s and 
Mr Gray’s claims are materially identical, so Ms Henderson’s claim is barred for illegality for the same reasons 
as Mr Gray’s [30 -31]. However, Ms Henderson argues that the reasoning in Gray does not apply or can be 
distinguished, because Gray concerned a claimant with significant personal responsibility for his crime. In 
contrast, in Ms Henderson’s criminal trial, the judge said that there was no suggestion that Ms Henderson 
should be seen as bearing a significant degree of responsibility for what she had done [82 ]. 
 
The Court rejects Ms Henderson’s  argument and finds that Gray cannot be distinguished. The crucial 
consideration in Gray  was that the claimant had been found to be criminally responsible for his conduct, not 
the degree of personal responsibility which that reflected [83-86]. Lord Phillips reserved judgment in Gray 
on whether the illegality defence would apply to a case where the claimant did not bear significant personal 
responsibility for their crime, but this was not the  view of the majority [79 -81]. 
 
Issue 2: Should the Court depart from Gray ? 
 In Patel, the Supreme Court held that the proper approach to the illegality defence at common law was one 
based on a balancing of public policy considerations rather than a reliance -based approach [61]. The majority  
held the underlying policy question to be whether allowing recovery for something which is illegal would  
produce inconsistency and disharmony in the law and so cause damage to the integrity of the legal system. 
In assessing whether the public interest would be harmed in that way, the court should consider a “trio of considerations”, namely: stage (a) the underlying purpose of the illegality in question, and whether that 
purpose would be enhanced by denying the claim; stage (b) any other relevant public policy on which denying 
the claim may have an impact; and stage (c) whether denying the claim would be a proportionate response 
to the illegality [66 -68, 113].  
 
With regard to the application of Patel, the Court confirms, first, that it concerned common law illegality 
rather than statutory illegality [74]; secondly, that although it  concerned a claim in unjust enrichment, the 
Court’s decision provides guidance on the proper approach to the common law illegality defence across civil 
law generally [76 ]; and thirdly that the principles identified in Patel are derived from the pre- existing case law 
and earlier decisions on the illegality defence remain of precedential value, unless they are incompatible with 
the Court’s reasoning in Patel [77 ].  
 
Ms Henderson  contends that the Court should depart from Gray on three grounds. The first ground is that 
the reasoning  in Gray is incompatible with the approach to illegality adopted by the Supreme Court in Patel . 
The Court finds, however, that the essential reasoning in Gray is consistent with Patel, and so remains good 
law [89 -96]. 
 
The second ground is that Gray should not apply where the claimant has no significant personal responsibility 
for the criminal act and/or there is no penal element in the sentence imposed on them by the criminal court  
[97-103]. The Court rejects this argument because allowing a claimant to recover damages for loss that results 
from: (i) the sentence imposed by the criminal court; and/or (ii) an intentional criminal act for which the 
claimant has been held to be criminally responsible would give rise to inconsistency that is damaging to the 
integrity of the legal system. The criminal under the criminal law would become the victim under the civil The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 law [106]. Requiring the civil court to assess whether or not a civil claimant has a significant degree of personal 
responsibility for their crime would create a clear risk of inconsistent decisions being reached in the criminal 
and civil courts [108 ]. In any case, it is unclear  why significant personal responsibility is the  appropriate  
threshold, and how the civil courts should decide whether a claimant meets that threshold [110-111]. There 
may be some exceptional trivial or strict liability offences which do not engage the illegality defence. 
However, the serious criminal offence of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility is not one of 
those exceptions [112].  
  
The third ground is that Ms Henderson’s  claim would be allowed under the trio of considerations approach 
in Patel [113-116]. With regard to the trio of considerations, the Court confirms first that they should usually 
be capable of being addressed as a matter of argument and at a level of generality that does not make evidence 
necessary [115]; secondly, that they involve a balancing between policy considerations arising under stages (a) 
and (b) and that stage (c) relates to proportionality and factors specific to the case rather than general policy 
considerations [116-120 ]; thirdly, that, where they arise, it is appropriate to give great weight to the policy 
considerations that a person should not be allowed to profit from his own wrongdoing and that the law 
should be coherent [121-122 ]; fourthly, that where the policy considerations come down firmly against denial 
of the claim it will not be necessary to consider stage (c) and proportionality [123 ]; and fifthly, that in relation 
to proportionality, centrality and the closeness of the causal link between the illegality and the claim will often 
be factors of particular importance [124 ]. 
 
In relation to stage (a), the policy reasons which support denial of Ms Henderson’s claim include the 
consistency and public confidence principles identified in Gray [119, 125 -126]. They also include: (i) the gravity 
of her criminal offence; (ii) the public interest in the proper allocation of NHS resources; (iii) the very close 
connection between her claim and her offence; and (iv) the public interest in deterring, protecting the public 
from and condemning unlawful killing [127-129]. Although a claimant in Ms Henderson’s position may not  
be deterred from unlawful killing by being deprived of a civil right to compensation, there may well be a 
broader deterrent effect in a clear rule that unlawful killing never pays. Any such effect is important given 
the fundamental importance of the right to life. To have such a rule also supports the public interest in public 
condemnation and due punishment [130 -131].  
 
In relation to stage (b), the policy reasons relied upon for allowing Ms Henderson’s negligence claim do not 
begin to outweigh those which support the denial of the claim. In particular, as Gray makes clear, the  resulting 
inconsistency in the law is such as to affect the integrity of the legal system and the underlying policy question identified in Patel is accordingly engaged [137 ]. 
 In relation to stage (c), the four factors relevant to proportionality identified in Patel do not show that denial 
of the claim would be disproportionate [138 -143]. It follows that the  trio of considerations approach in Patel 
does not lead to a different outcome in Ms Henderson’s case [144]. Gray should therefore be affirmed as 
being “Patel compliant” and should be applied and followed in similar cases [ 145]. 
 
Issue 3: Can Ms Henderson recover  damages for any of the heads of loss she has claimed?  
 The Court answers this question “no”. Ms Henderson cannot claim damages for loss of liberty or for loss of 
amenity during her detention in hospital because these heads of loss result from the sentence imposed on 
her by the criminal court. The other heads of loss cannot be recovered  because they result from Ms 
Henderson’s unlawful killing of her mother [148 ]. It would be inappropriate for the Court to subvert the  
operation of the Forfeiture Act 1982 , which prevents Ms Henderson from recovering her full share of her 
mother’s estate [149 ].

 The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Stoffel & Co’s appeal , and holds tha t Ms Grondona’s claim

the Court agree.

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.suprem ecourt.uk  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
 
The Supreme Court decision in Patel v Mirza  [2016] UKSC 42 set out a new  policy -based  approach to  
the illegality defence  at common law . In that case, th e majority held that , when a claim is tainted by 
illegality, the court should ask itself whether e nforcing  the claim would  lead to inconsistency  that is 
damaging to the integrity of the legal system . In making this assessment, the court should consider : (a) 
the underlying purpose  of the illegality in question, and whether that purpose w ould be enhanced by 
denying the claim ; (b) any other relevant publi c policy on which denying  the claim may have  an impact ; 
and ( c) whether denying  the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality  [22-23]. 
 
The application of this trio of considerations should not be a mechanistic process . Accordingly, the  court 
will identify the  policy considerations at stages (a) and (b) of the trio at a relatively general  level. The 
court’s task is to establish  whether enforcing a claim that is tainted with illegality would be inconsistent 
with the polici es to which the law gives effect or, where the policies compete, to decide where the balance 
lies. The court  is not require d to evaluate the  underlying  policies themselves . 
 In contrast, when considering proportionality at stage (c), it is likely that the court will  need to look 
closely at the case before it. However, it is not necessary for the court to consider proportionality in 
every case. If, after it has examined the policy considerations at stages (a) and (b), the court determines 
that the claim should not be barred by the illegality defence, there will be no need for it to go on to 
consider proportionality. This is because the claim will be allowed, so there is no risk of disproportionate 
harm to the claimant by refusing relief to which he or she  would otherwise be entitled [ 26].  
 In considering stage (a), Lord Lloyd- Jones observes that Ms Grondona was engaged in mortgage fraud, 
which is a serious criminal offence. However, denying her  claim would not enhance the underlying 
purpose of the prohibition on mortgage fraud. F raudsters are unlikely to be deterred by the risk that they 
will be left without a civil remedy if their solicitor s prove to be negligent [ 29]. On the other hand,  allowing 
Ms Grondona’s claim would enhance the protection that the law provides to mortgagees and other 
members of the public , which is a  further underlying purpose of the prohibition on mortgage fraud. By 
the time of Stoffel & Co’s negligence, it was in the interest s of both Ms Grondona and Birmingham 
Midshires that the transfer should be registered [ 30-31].  
 Turning to stage (b), denying Ms Grondona’s claim would run counter to a number of important public 
polici es. In particular, it would be inconsistent with the policy that  solicitors should perform their duties 
to their clients diligently and without negligence, as well as with the policy that the victims of solicitors’ 
negligence should be compensated for the loss they have suffered  [32]. Denying the claim would also 
result in an incoherent contradiction in the law, because  the law accepts that an equitable interest in the 
property passed to Ms Grondona,  even though she was engaged in mortgage fraud [33-34].  
 The balancing of the policy considerations at stages (a) and (b) indicate that Ms Grondona’s claim should 
not be barred by the illegality defence. There is, consequently, no need to consider proportionality, but  
Lord Lloyd -Jones does  so nevertheless  [35]. He concludes that it would not be  proportionate to deny 
Ms Grondona’s claim  because it is conceptually entirely separate from the mortgage fraud [ 43].  
 Enforcing the claim would not allow  Ms Grondona  to profit from her wrongdoing  [44-45]. In any case, 
following Patel v Mirza , the court’s focus should be on the need to avoid inconsistency that is damaging 
to the integrity of the legal system . The question of whether the claimant will profit from the illegality 
remains a relevant consideration, but it i s no longer  the true focus of the court’s inquiry  [46].

 The Supreme Court allows  the appeal . The Court unanimously holds that the Home Secretary breached 
her procedural duty to act  fairly by failing  promptly to notify the Appellant  of the revocation of his 
sponsor’s licence.  The majority of the J ustices (Lord Kerr, Lady Black, and Lord Briggs) hol d that the 
Home Secretary was not under a further  duty to provide a period of time following notification to enable 
the Appellant  to react to the revocation of his sponsor’s licenc e. Lord Wilson and Lady Arden concluded 
that the law did impose this further  duty on the Home Secretary . Lord Briggs would have dismissed the 
appeal despite the Home Secretary’s breach of the duty promptly to notify .  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
Issue  (i): Did the Home Secretary’s failure promptly to notify the A ppellant of the revocation of 
his sponsor’s licen ce breach the  duty of procedural fairness?  
 The Court  unanimously answers this question “yes”. Lord Kerr and Lady Black  (delivering a joint 
judgment)  consider that it is a “ self-evident ” aspect of that duty for the Home Secretary to ensure that the 
Appellant  had timely notice that, for a wholly unanticipated reason, his application was bound to fail 
(carrying potentially devastating consequences). They find that this duty  is underpinned by the notion 
that a p erson such as the A ppellant should be afforded as much opportunity as reasonably possible to 
accommodate and deal with such a decision [ 107].  
  
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
Lord Kerr and Lady  Black consider that this  duty can be characterised as procedural rather than 
substantive because it is a negative duty : an obligation not to deprive the Appellant of the chance to 
avoid , or mitigate the effects of , the Home Secretary’s adverse decision on his application [108 ]. The 
Appellant would ultimately have to be notified that his sponsor’s licence had been revoked , and so the 
duty promptly to notify does not create any novel positive obligations [ 112]. Nor does the fact that the 
procedural duty may result in the opportunity to avoid the effect of an adverse outcome affect that conclusion [ 137-140]. Consequently, the duty arose  as a matter of procedural fairness.  
 Lord Briggs agrees that the Home Secretary’s failure to notify constituted procedural unfairness,  but he 
does not consider that this breach justifies the Court set ting aside  the Home Secretary’s decision. He 
considers that the A ppellant’s lost opportunity to improve his position resulted from th e Home 
Secretary’s voluntary (and probably unconscious) three -month delay in dealing with the application  and 
that, because the delay was a mere “ happenstance ” and the Home Secretary was not obliged to give the 
Appellant any such breathing space , this brea ch ought not  to render the decision unlawful [ 197].  
 Issue (ii): Was the Home Secretary under a duty to provide a period of time following 
notification to enable the A ppellant to react to the revocation of his sponsor’s licen ce? 
 The majority answer this question “no”. Lord Kerr and Lady Black consider that the duty to act fairly in 
the circumstances involves a “ duty not to deprive, not an obligation to create ”. To require the Home Secretary 
to grant a grace period  following notifi cation  would be to impose a positive duty  and an extra extension 
of leave beyond that set out in the legislation  or Immigration Rules [108 -109]. This would be a substantive 
duty, falling outside of the bounds of procedural fairness [ 108; 141 ]. 
 Lord Briggs agrees  that a duty to provide a grace period following notification would be a substantive 
duty going beyond that set out in the Immigration Rules [164 ; 187]. He reasons that, if time is sought to 
change or improve the underlying facts to make the m more favourable , the issue  is probably substantive 
[177]. A grant of time to find new sponsored employment so as to  qualify for Tier 2 leave to remain is 
therefore substantive [ 180]. So too is a grant of t ime to prepare for an orderly departure from the UK 
[178]. Furthermore, the ultimate consequence of the Home Secretary’s failure to grant a grace period —
that the Appellant  became an overstayer —is itself a matter of substance [ 183].   
 Lord Briggs also considers that the duty to provide a grace period would be “ perhaps a rare example of 
pointlessness ” [162] and that the principles that underlie procedural fairness have no application to a 
situation where the decision is inevitable  (as was the outcome of the Appellant’s original application)  
[158; 162 ]. Equally, t he “collateral advantage ” of being able to take alternative steps as a lawful migrant 
while being protected from being an overstayer is not one which procedural fairness is designed to protect [164 -165]. Consequently, the Home Secretary’s failure to provide a grace period was not 
challengeable under that head of ju dicial review (nor any other) [ 187].  
 In separate judgments, Lady Arden  and Lord Wilson disagree  with the majority . Lady Arden holds that 
the duty falls under procedural fairness because establishing a procedural impropriety is a necessary first step [27- 28]. The substantive element in the challenge  is a consequence  of the procedural fairness 
argument rather than vice versa [32], and this conclusion is supported both by the fact that the Home 
Secretary’s substantive decision is unchallenged [74] and by the fact that the rule in question is unaffected 
by the determination of procedural unfairness [ 75].  
 Lady Arden also considers that this is not a case of pointlessness: if granted a grace period, the Appellant would have a chance (which may only be small ) that he may find a new basis for applying for leave to 
remain [61 ]. Rather, it is pointless to impose a duty on the Home Secretary to notify the Appellant 
promptly if that duty is not accompanied by a grace period giving the Appellant  a meaningful opport unity 
to take steps in light of that notification  [72]. She also considers that the opportunity to take  any such  
steps ought not to depend “ serendipitously ” on the amount of time that happens to pass between 
notification and rejection  [72]. She agrees with the judgment of Lord Wilson [ 92].

 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
Lord Wilson agrees with Lady Arden. He holds that the duty of fairness at common law can impose 
positive obligations [ 203-204] and that a duty to provide a grace period would not be inconsistent either 
with the statute or the Immigration Rules [205]. He queries how, “ without departure from ordinary meaning ”, 
the Appellant’s  complaint could be described as not being procedural [ 208]. Furthermore, he finds that 
a duty of prompt notification would be “ to give nothing of value ” to the Appellant unless accompanied by a 
duty to provide a grace period  and that “ the law should not i mpose a duty nor confer a right if they are of no value ” 
[217]. He finds that the Home Secretary would have  been likely to refuse the Appellant’s application 
immediately after notification if it were only subject to a duty of prompt notification [ 221]. Consequently, 
he considers that  only both duties—taken together —would yield the Appellant  a reasonable time within 
which, while not suffering the serious consequences of being an overstayer, he could seek to vary his leave to remain application or seek leave to remain outside the Immigration R ules [ 222].  He therefore 
considers that procedural fairness requires both duties to be imposed.

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Equality Act 2010  
 
The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to discriminate directly against any person on the basis of certain 
characteristics, known as protected characteristics. These include ‘ race’ and ‘religion or belief ’ [17] -[18] .  
 However, the Act sets out exemptions where certain actions will not be considered as unlawful direct discrimination. Section 158 provides one such exemption where positive  action addresses in a 
proportionate manner needs or disadvantages connected to a protected characteristic [19] . Section 193  sets 
out two further exemptions. Section 19 3(2)(a) permits charities to restrict benefits to those with a protected 
characteristic if that restriction is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim and section 193(2)(b) 
permits charities to restrict benefits to those who share a protected characteristic if the restriction seeks to 
prevent or compensate for a disadvantage linked to the characteristic [21] .  
 
Lord Sales  upholds the lower courts’ findings that the Housing Charity’s  allocation policy is proportionate 
and lawful under sections 158 and 193(2)(a) of the Equality Act 20 10. A proportionality assessment first 
requires the identificat ion of a legitimate aim and, secondly, consideration of whether the measures taken to 
promote th at aim are proportionate, having regard to other interests at stake  [65] . The dispute in this case  
centres on what constitutes a legitimate aim [60] -[72]. As found by the Divisional Court and the Court of 
Appeal, the legitimate aims here include the minimisation of disadvantages which are connected to the 
Haredi community’s religious identity and counteracting discrimination which they suffer, including in the 
private housing market, and the fulfilment of relevant needs which are particular to that community [66] . 
The Housing Charity was entitled to adopt a clear and strict rule about who could and could not ap ply for 
its social housing, which meant that it was made available just for members of the Orthodox Jewish 
community, to ensure that its charitable activities were focused on that community, so that its activities did 
in fact fulfil its charitable objective to alleviate the problems of that community [76 ]-[87] . Lord Sales holds 
that the Divisional Court correctly considered the Housing Charity’s allocation policy in the light of the 
applicable legal framework and, accordingly, was entitled to find it to be proportionate and lawful under 
these statutory exemptions . Lord Sales makes his own assessment of proportionality [76] -[87] , which is in 
agreement  with that of the Divisional Court [73] .  
 
Lord Sales  holds that, in any event, the Court of Appeal was right to say that the Divisional Court’s finding 
of proportionality could only be set aside if it had misdirected itself or reached a decision which was wrong. 
Applying this approach , he holds that the Divisional Court had been entitled to make this finding, with the 
result that its decision should be upheld on appeal  [74]-[75] .  
 In her concurring judgment, Lady Arden emphasises  that an appellate court should generally not make its 
own assessment of proportionality in such circumstances [120] , and with this caveat she agrees with the 
judgment of Lord Sales [121].   
 
As regards the exemption in section 193(2)(b), the Court dismisses the argument for the appellants that the 
provision is subject to an implied proportionality requirement. There is no sound basis on which such a 
requirement could be read into the provision [97] . First, even on the assumption that the case is within the 
ambit of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the “ECHR ”), on the right to respect 
for private and family life, so that Article 14 of the ECHR (non- discrimination) is applicable, any 
proportionality requirement inherent in that provision is satisfied by the structure of section 193 itself; 
Parliament was entitled to create a clear rule applicable to charities in the interests of conserving their resources for use in fulfilling their charitable objectives, having regard, among other things , to the 
regulation of charities under the Charities Act 2011 to ensure they operate in the public interest and the wide margin of appreciation accorded to Parliament, as the body with democratic authority, in setting social 
and economic policy, including encouragement for giving to charity [97] -[110] . Secondly, on the same 
assumption that the case falls within the ambit of Article 8 of the ECHR, even if the structure of section 
193 itself did not satisfy any relevant proportionality standard, the drafting of the provision and the policy 
underlying it are so clear that it would not be possible to read into it an additional proportionality 
requirement [111]-[115] . In the circumstances, therefore, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether 
the case falls within the ambit of Article 8 of the ECHR and the Court prefers to leave that issue open [ 96, 
116]. Section 193(2)(b) should be applied according to its express terms. It is common ground that, on this 
basis, the requirements of section 193(2)(b) are satisfied in this case [50] . Even if a proportionality The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 requirement could be read into the provision, it follows from the decision regarding proportionality in 
relation to section 158 and section 193(2)(a) that it would have been satisfied [55, 88].  
 
The Race Directive  
 
The Race Directive  provides that discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin must be  unlawful, 
particularly in relation to housing [89]. The Court finds that the Housing Charity is not in contravention of 
this directive for the simple reason that its allocation policy differentiates on the basis of religious observance 
and not race or ethnic origin [89]-[90] .

 The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Burrows gives the sole  judgment . The Court 
holds that both offence s are offences of strict liability. Negligence by the business operator does not 
have to be proved.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 Regulation 30(1)(g) of the WATOK Regulations provides that it is an offence to contravene the EU Regulation. Article 3(1) of the EU Regulation provides th at “Animals shall be spared any avoidable pain, 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 distress or suffering during their killing and related operations.” Article 15(1), Annex III, point 3.2 of 
the EU Regulation provides that “in case of simple stunning… the two carotid arteries or the vessels from which they arise shall be systematically severed… Further dressing or scalding shall only be performed once the absence of signs of life of the animal has been verified” [9].  
 HPFPL submitted  that it was sufficient for negligence to be required under either the EU Regulation or 
the WATOK Regulation. As to the latter,  in interpreting a domestic legal provision, there is a 
presumption that a crime requires mens rea or culpability [11] . However, t he Court holds that the 
WATOK Regulations are no more than  the mechanism through which the EU Regulation is  given effect  
in domestic law . It is solely the interpretation of the EU Regulation that matter s. In general, an EU 
regulation leaves M ember States with the discretion to decide whether to create criminal offences in their 
domestic legislation. The WATOK Regulations 2015 create such offences [14] . However, while member 
states have a discretion as regards penalties, they have no discretion to lower the standards required by the EU r egulation  in question . If the EU r egulation imposes strict liability, the domestic r egulation must 
do the same [15]. Thus, i f HPFPL fails to establish that negligence is required under the EU Regulation, 
then it cannot succeed on the basis that, in any event, regulation 30(1)(g) of the  WATOK Regulation s 
2015 require s negligence and does not impose strict liability [1 6]. 
 The EU Regulation ha s to be interprete d in accordance with EU law principles [19] . Insofar as t hey are 
different, domestic rules of statutory interpretation are displaced by those  principles [23]. The 
teleological approach to legislative interpretation required by EU law means that there is a heavy stress on seeking to ensure that the interpretation of the words fulfils the purposes of the legislative provision and, more generally, the purposes of the EU [27] . The imposition of strict liability in the context of 
criminal law is not contrary to EU law [28] . 
 The wording of a rticle 15(1) , requiring the severing of the carotid arteries,  suggests the imposition  of 
strict liability . There is  no hint that business operators shall be liable only if the operational rules are 
intentionally or negligently infringed [33] . This interpretation is supported by the purpose of the 
provision. Strict liability imposes a clear and easily enforceable standard, uniform across the EU, and  
avoids the difficulty in pinpointing the individual upon whom the requisite state of mind must be 
attributed [34]. Article 15(1)  therefore  impose s strict liability [37] . 
 The wording of a rticle 3(1), requiring animals to be s pared any avoidable suffering during their killing, 
also suggests strict liability [39]. Recital (2) to the EU Regulation, despite mentioning suffering being 
induced “by negligence or intention ”, does not affect the wording of a rticle 3(1). It merely clari fies that 
a breach of article 3(1) will usually entail fault. Negligence or intention are examples of the ways in which a breach of the EU Regulation induces suffering, but they do not form an exhaustive list [48] . The 
recitals to an EU regulation cannot b e interpreted in such a way as to contradict the clear wording of 
that regulation [49] . Further, the earlier incarnation of the EU Regulation, Directive 93/119/EEC, did 
not include the words “negligence or intention” in the relevant recital . It is highly u nlikely that the EU 
would have made its animal welfare requirements less strict under the EU Regulation than under the Directive it replaced  [52] . Article 3(1) therefore also impose s strict liability [53] .

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses both appeals . The full Court gives the judgment , which 
confirms that  the contractual arrangeme nts ETSI has created under its IPR Policy give the English courts 
jurisdiction to determine the terms of a global license of a multi -national patent portfolio.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The appeals raise five issues , all of which are important to the international market in 
telecommunications [1].  
 
Issue 1: The  jurisdiction issue  
 
The jurisdiction issue arises in both appeals. The Supreme Court is asked to decide whether the English 
court s have jurisdiction and may properly exercise a power, without both parties’ agreement: (a) to grant 
an injunction to restrain the infringement of a UK patent that is a SEP unless the implementer of the 
patented invention enters into a global licence of a multi -national patent portfolio; and (b) to determine 
the royalty rates and other terms of such a licence  [49].  
 
The Court finds that the English courts have jurisdiction and may properly exercise these powers. 
Questions as to the validity and infringement of a national patent fall to be determined by the courts of 
the state which has granted the patent.  However, the contractual arrangements ETSI ha s created under 
its IPR Policy give the English courts jurisdiction to determine the terms of a license of a portfolio of 
patents which includes foreign patents [ 58]. 
 
The Court begins by considering Huawei’s argument that, properly construed, ETSI’s IPR Policy only 
permits the English courts to determine the terms of a license of UK SEPs and only where those SEPs 
have already been held by the English courts to be valid and infringed  [54]. The Court rejects this 
argument  on the basis that it runs counter to the aims of the IPR Policy and does not adequately take  
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 the wider context into account [ 59-60]. The Court also rejects Huawei’s submission that the IPR Policy 
prohibit s a SEP owner from seeking an injunction from a national court where it establishes that an 
implementer is infringing its patent. Rather, the possibility that a national court might grant an injunction 
is a necessary part of the balance which the IPR Polic y seeks to strike, because it incentivises 
implementers to negotiate and accept FRAND terms for the use of the SEP owner’s portfolio [ 61].  
 
Huawei argues  that there is a clear distinction between  the terms that operators might choose to agree  
voluntarily as part of a commercial negotiation and the terms that can be imposed on them by the courts  
[53]. The Court rejects this distinction.  It finds that the IPR Policy  envisages  both that the courts may 
decide whether or not the terms of an offered licence are FRAND  and that the courts should look to 
and draw on commercial practice in the real world when making this assessment [ 62].   
 
The Court goes on to disagree with Huawei’s submission (at [51]) that the English courts do not have 
jurisdiction to determine the terms of a licence of disputed (or potentially disputed) foreign patents . In 
the present appeals, the lower courts did not attempt to rule on the validity or infringement of foreign 
patents,  which would have been beyond their jurisdiction. Instead, they looked to the industry practice 
of taking a license of a portfolio of patents and construed ETSI’s IPR Policy as promoting that behaviour 
[63]. If an implementer is concerned about the validit y and infringement of particularly significant 
patents  in a portfolio , it could seek to reserve the right to challenge those patents and to require that the 
royalties payable under the licence should be reduced if the challenge is successful [ 64-65].   
 
The Court  also disagrees with Huawei’s submission (at  [52]) that the approach of the English courts is 
out of step with that of foreign courts [ 66]. It finds that  the trial judge’s approach in the Unwired appeal 
is consistent with several judgments in other jurisdictions, which contemplate that, in an appropriate 
case, the courts would determine the terms of a global FRAND licence [ 67-84]. The Court also dismisses  
Huaw ei’s argument  (at [55]) that it is improper for an English court to exclude Huawei’s products from 
the UK market by exercising a discretion to grant an  injunction in respect of an infringement of a SEP 
[85-90]. 
 
Issue 2: The suitable  forum issue  
 
The suitable forum issue arises in the Conversant appeal  only. It has two limbs. The first  limb asks 
whether the High Court  should have : (a) set aside  service of Huawei and ZTE out of jurisdiction; and 
(b) permanently stayed the proceedings as against the English subsidiaries of Huawei and ZTE on the 
basis that China was a more suitable forum for hearing the dispute than England [ 92].  
 
The suitable forum (or “forum conveniens ”) doctrine requires the English court to decide whether it or 
a suggested foreign court  with jurisdiction  would be the more suitable forum for determining the dispute 
between the parties [ 94]. Huawei and ZTE argue that the Chinese c ourts would be a more suitable forum 
for determin ing their dispute with Conversant. However, the  Court holds that t his argument must fail 
because the Chinese courts do not currently have  the jurisdiction  needed to determine the terms of a 
global FRAND lice nce, at least, without all parties’ agreement that they should do so. In contrast, the 
English court has jurisdiction to do this [ 96-97].  
 
The second limb, which the Court labels “case management”, is whether the English proceedings should 
be stayed tempo rarily until the Chinese proceedings challenging the validity of Conversant’s Chinese 
patents have been concluded  [92]. The Court finds that the Court of Appeal was right to refuse any case 
management solution [ 103-104].  
 
Issue 3: The non-discrimination issue  
 
The non -discrimination issue arises in the Unwired appeal and relates to the requirement that license 
terms must be non -discriminatory. Huawei argues that th e non -discrimination  limb of the FRAND 
undertaking  is “hard -edged”, which  means that like situations must be treated alike and different 
situations differently. SEP owners like Unwired must therefore grant the same or similar terms to all 
licensees, unless it can be shown that there are objective reasons for treating them diffe rently.  
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Accordingly, Unwired should have offered Huawei a licence with a worldwide royalty rate which was as 
favourable as those it ha d previously agreed with Samsung [105-106].  
 
The Court  holds that Unwired had not breached the non-discrimination limb of  the FRAND 
undertaking  [112]. ETSI’s IPR Policy requires SEP owners, like Unwired, to make licenses available  “on 
fair, reasonable and non -discriminatory… terms and conditions”. This is  a single, composite obligation, 
not three distinct obligations that the licen ce terms should be fair, and separately, reasonable, and 
separately, non -discriminatory [ 113]. The “non -discriminatory” part of the undertaking indicates that, to 
qualify as FRAN D, a single royalty price list should be available to all market participants . This must be 
based on the market value of the patent portfolio, without adjustment for the characteristics of individual 
licensees  [114]. However, there is no requirement for SEP owners to grant licences on terms equivalent 
to the most favourable licen ce terms to all similarly situated licensees. Indeed, ETSI previously rejected 
proposals to include a “most favourable licence” term of this kind in the FRAND undertaking [ 116-119].  
 
Issue 4: The competition issue  
 
In the Unwired appeal, Huawei argues that Unwired’s claim for an injunction should be regarded as an 
abuse of its dominant position, contrary to Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European 
Union. This is because Unwired has failed to comply with the guidance given by the Court of Justice of 
the European Union in Huawei v ZTE  (Case C -170/13) , since it did not make  a FRAND licence offer 
before issuing proceedings for injunctive relief . Huawei argues that, as a result, Unwired’s remedy  should 
have been limited to damages  [128-129].  
 
The Court considers Article 102 [ 131], Huawei v ZTE  [132-143], the facts of the present case [ 144-145] 
and the decisions of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal [ 146-148]. It confirms that bringing an ac tion 
for a prohibit ory injunction without notice or prior consultation with the alleged infringer will infringe 
Article 102 [ 150]. However, the nature of the notice or consultation required will depend on the 
circumstances of the case: there is no mandator y requirement to follow the protocol set out in Huawei v 
ZTE. On the facts, what matte red wa s that Unwired ha d shown itself to be willing to grant a licence to 
Huawei on whatever terms the court decided were FRAND . Unwired had not therefore behaved 
abusively  [151-158].  
 
Issue 5: The remedies issue  
 
In both appeals, Huawei argues that, even if it is infringing Unw ired and Conversant’s SEPs, the court 
should not have grant ed an injunction to stop the continuing infringement. Instead, the  more 
appropriate and proportionate remedy would be for the court to award the claimants damages, based on 
the royalties which woul d reasonably be agreed for a licen ce of the infringed UK patents [ 159]. The 
Supreme Court  rejects this argument. I t holds that there is no basis on which the Court  could properly 
substitute an award of damages for the injunction granted in the Unwired appeal and upheld by the 
Court of Appeal [ 163]. There is no risk that Unwired or Conversant could use the threat of an injunction 
as a means of charging exorbitant fee s, since they cannot enforce their rights unless they have offered to 
license their SEPs on terms which the court is satisfied are FRAND [ 164-165]. Moreover , an award of 
damages would not be an adequate substitute for an injunction  [166-169].

 The Supreme Court unanimously allows  the appeal  and dismisses Peninsula’s common law claim . Lord 
Wilson gives the lead judgment, with which Lord Lloyd- Jones, L ady Arden  and L ord Kitchin agree. Lord  
Carnwath gives a concurring judgment . 
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 Lord Wilson observes that the court’s duty  in this appeal  is to examine  the decision in Esso  in the light 
of questions of logic and public policy and to ask whether the surrender of a pre -existing freedom is an 
acceptable criterion for engagement of the doctrine [16].

 Dunnes made a preliminary argument  that, as neither Mr Shortall, a developer, nor Peninsula , a property 
holding company, was a trader , no restraint on them could be a  restraint of trade . That argument appears 
to be t oo narrow. The covenant does restrain trade because it restrains Peninsula from cau sing or 
permitting a trade in specified goods in a retail unit of a specified size on the site [17] . 
 
The Esso case concerned a type of covenant under which the owner of a petrol station undertakes to 
buy from a particular supplier a ll the petrol to be sold at the station (“ a solus agreement ”). The 
respondent had entered into two solus agreements with Esso, each in respect of a different petrol  station 
[19]. The respondent later repudiated the agreements and Esso sought an injunction requir ing it to abide 
by them  [20]. In the House of Lords, Lord Reid, with the support of the majority,  formulated what has 
become known as the “pre -existing f reedom” test : he stated that a covenant restraining  the use of land  
would engage the doctrine if , on entering into it , the person doing so (“the covenantor”)  “gives up 
some freedom which otherwise  he would have had”  [23-24]. He held, again with majority support, that  
in relation to both ag reements  the doctrine was engaged  [28]. Lord  Wilberforce  put forward a different 
test, known as the “trading society” test , under which a covenant restrain ing the use of land does not 
engage the doctrine if it is of a type which has “passed into the accepted and normal currency of commercial or contractual or conveyancing relations” and which may therefore be taken to have “assumed a form which satisfies the te st of public policy”  [26, 46]. Applying this test , he, too, concluded 
that the solus agreements engage d the doctrine  [28] . 
 The pre-existing freedom test  has received intense academic criticism [31] . In terms of public policy, 
which is the foundation of the doctrine, there is n o explanation why a restraint should engage the 
doctrine if the covenantor enjoyed a pre -existing freedom but why an identical restraint should not 
engage it if he did not do so [44]. The trading society test, by contrast, is consonant with the doctrine 
[47]. The court should therefore make use of its ability, recognised in the Practice Statement (Judicial 
Precedent) [1966] 1 WLR 1234, to depart from a previous decision of the House of Lords, a nd should 
depart from the pre -existing freedom test  formulated in the Esso  case [49-50]. The objections to the test  
are that it has no principled place within the doctrine; that it has been criticised for over 50 years  but 
scarcely defended ; and that courts in Australia and parts o f Canada have rejected it [32 -43, 50] . 
 Application of  the trading society test to the facts of this case  is straightforward  and so there is no need 
to send the matter back to a lower court . For it has long been accepted and  normal for the grant of a 
lease in part of a shopping centre to include a restrictive covenant on the part of the landlord in relation 
to the use of other parts of the centre. It follows that the covenant in this case has at no time engaged the doctrine [51]. So the question of whether the  assignment of the burden of the covenant to Peninsula 
affect ed the engagement of the doctrine  no longer arises [52] . Peninsula seeks an alternative remedy  
under the Property (Northern Ireland) Order 1978, which gives the Lands Tribunal or the High Court  
the power to make an order modifying or extinguishing the covenant if it constitutes an impediment to the enjoyment of land . That is  a more satisfactory veh icle for resolution of the issues in this case . 
Peninsula’s claim under the  Order should now proceed to be heard [54 -57]. 
 In his concurring judgment Lord Carnwath agrees that the pre -existing freedom test should be discarded 
in favour of the trading socie ty test and that the appeal should be allowed [59- 60, 68] . As an exception 
to ordinary principles of freedom of contract, the doctrine should not be extended without justification beyond established categories [61] . What matters is the practical effect of the restriction in the real world, 
and its significance in public policy terms  [62].This case is different from Esso  and the other trading 
cases: for the agreement is not in essence an agreement between traders but a transaction in land. The only trade whi ch might be inhibited by it is that of a potential future occupier. None of the authorities 
suggests that there is any public policy reason or legal basis for protecting that mere possibility  [63]. The 
covenant in this case does not restrict, but rather facilitates, the developer’s business [65] .

By a majority, the Supreme Court  partially allows the appeal, holding that the omission gave  rise to a charge 
to inheritance tax,  but the transfer did  not. Lady Black gives the lead judgment, with which Lord Reed and 
Lord Kitchin agree. Lord Hodge gives a separate judgment, dissenting in part, with which Lord Sales agrees.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
Inheritance tax is chargeable on the value transferred by a “disposition” which is a “transfer of value”  under 
the IHTA. Section 3(3) IHTA extends the meaning of “disposition” to include deliberate omissions by which  
the disponor’s estate  is diminished and the value of another person’s estate is increased. Section 10(1) IHTA 
provides that a disposition that “was not intended, and was not made in a transaction  intended, to confer any gratuitous 
benefit on any person” is not a “transfer of value” and so does not give rise to a charge to inheritance tax . Section 
10(3) IHTA provides that a “transaction ” for section 10(1) purposes “includes a series of transactions and any 
associated operations” [6-13 ]. 
 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 In the lead judgment, Lady Black sets out the three issues that arise on the appeal: (1) whether section 10 
IHTA applies  to the transfer as a disposition viewed on its own , i.e. whether the transfer was  “not intended … 
to confer any gratuitous benefit on any person ” (“Transfer Issue 1”); (2) whether section 10 IHTA applies  to the 
transfer looked at in its wider context, i.e. whether the transfer was “not … made in a transaction intended to confer 
any gratuitous benefit on any person” (“Transfer Issue 2”); and (3) whether the terms of section 3(3) are satisfied 
in respect of the omission, i.e. whether, by her omission to draw pension benefits from the PPP , the value 
of Mrs Staveley’s estate was diminished and the values of her sons’ estates were increased (“Omission  
Issue”) [17 -20]. 
 
Transfer Issue 1 (transfer on its own)  
 
Section 10 IHTA applies where the overall effect of the disposition is not intended by the disponor to confer 
a gratuitous benefit. In the present case, the transfer had not been motivated by any intention to improve the 
sons’ position. Mrs Staveley’s sole intention in transferring the funds was to eliminate any risk that any part 
of the funds might be returned to her ex- husband. The mere fact that the sons’ inheritance was intended to 
be enjoyed in a different legal form after the transfer did not mean that Mrs Staveley intended to confer a 
gratuitous benefit her sons . When viewed on its own, section 10 IHTA applied to the transfer [65 , 66]. 
 
Transfer Issue 2 (transfer and omission as associated operations) 
 
The parties accepted that, in omitting to draw lifetime benefits under the PPP, part of Mrs Staveley’s intention 
was to benefit her sons. The question for the Supreme Court was whether this intention colour ed the transfer 
with an intention to confer gratuitous benefit which the transfer would not have on its own. The majority of 
the Supreme Court did not accept, as the Court of Appeal had found, that the omission and the transfer 
together for med part of a scheme (a “series of transactions and any associated operations”) intended to confer a 
gratuitous benefit. The present case could be distinguished from Inland Revenue Comrs v Macpherson [1989] AC 
159, where the House of Lords had found that a  series of operations formed part of a such a scheme and so  
gave rise to tax . In Macpherson, the operations under consideration had been clearly linked by a common 
intention. In contrast, in the present case, Mrs Staveley’s essential scheme had been her omission to draw a 
lifetime pension in order to benefit her sons by leaving them her death benefits. That could have been 
achieved without the transfer. Accordingly, the transfer and the omission were not linked by a common 
intention and did not form part of a single scheme intended confer a gratuitous benefit on any person. Section 
10 IHTA therefore applied to the transfer, even when viewed in its wider context . It followed that the transfer 
did not give rise to a charge to inheritance tax  [67, 88]. 
 The Omission Issue  
 The limited discretion of the pension scheme administrator did not break the chain connecting the omission 
and the payment of the death benefit. The omission was the operative cause of  the increase in the sons’ 
estates and  therefore gave rise to a charge to inheritance tax under section 3(3) IHTA [94] . 
 
Lord Hodge  would have dismissed the appeal in relation to the transfer and the omission. He agrees with 
Lady Black on Transfer Issue 1 and the Omission Issue but reaches a different conclusion on Transfer Issue 
2. The transfer, when taken with the omission and the nomination of the sons as beneficiaries of the death 
benefit, formed a contributory part of a scheme to confer a gratuitous benefit. Mrs Staveley’s intention to 
benefit her sons pre- dated the transfer and was reflected in her nomination in the PPP. Therefore, he 
concludes, section 10 does not apply and tax ought to be payable [104, 109] .

 The Supreme Court  unanimously allows  the appeal  and restores the judgment in favour of the appellant . 
Lord Hamblen and Lord Leggatt  give the judgmen t, with which all members of the Court  agree.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 The issue on the appeal is whether the Court of Appeal’s criticisms were justified and warranted remitting 
the case for fresh determination. The four main criticisms were that  the judge: (i) failed to follow the 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901  www.supremecourt.uk  
 logical steps necessary to reach a proper evaluation of the admissible evidence ; (ii) failed to ask and 
answer the correct legal question as to what weight should be accorded to the confession evidence ; (iii) 
fell into legal error in failing to take all the appropriate matters into account in deciding the bribery issu e; 
and (iv) fell into legal error in failing to exclude irrelevant matters, including what the Court of Appeal 
described as his “lingering doubt” as to whether the confessions were procured by torture, in considering 
whether the alleged bribe was paid  [51]-[52]. 
 On the first criticism, the judge had considered the bribery issue  before the torture allegations  [41]-[44]. 
The Court of Appeal took the view that the judge should have decided the torture allegations first  and, 
having concluded the confession evidence was admissible, proceeded to determine the weight to be 
given to th at evidence, then subsequently have conside red whether bribery had taken place [55] -[56]. 
The Supreme Court accepts that the Court of Appeal’s approach is logical , but it is not mandatory. The 
manner and order of the consideration  of admissibility and weight of evidence  are matter s for the trial 
judge and there will usually be more than one legitimate approach  [57]-[58]. The judge took the 
confession evidence into account on the assumption, without deciding, that the evidence was a dmissible. 
That was a permissible approach [59] . Having done so, t he judge considered it unnecessary to make a 
finding on the torture issues because he was in any event satisfied there was no bribery . The approach 
taken was both legitimate and consistent w ith the way the case was put before him [62] , [65].   
 On the second criticism, the Court of Appeal considered that the judge had not adequately addressed 
the weight to be given to the confession evidence [66] . Though not separately set out, the Supreme 
Court considers that the judge did address the weight of the evidence in the facto rs relied upon in his 
conclusion on bribery . In circumstances where that evidence was the only evidence of bribery, in finding 
that there was no bribery the judge was necessarily finding that the confession evidence was of little or no weight .  It cannot b e said that his conclusion on bribery was unreasonable or unsustainable  and there 
were ample grounds to support it [67] -[84].  
 On the third criticism, the Court of Appeal considered that the judge failed to take into account the 
details of the confessions made and should have addressed each confession made by each individual rather than dealing with them compendiously [85] . Though the Supreme Court agrees that it would have 
been more satisfactory for the judge to have addressed the confession evidence in greater detail, it is clear that he did consider the confession evidence of all three individuals . The failure to consider it 
systemat ically is not an error of law  [85] -[87]. 
 On the fourth criticism, the Court of Appeal considered that , as the judge  did not find the allegation of 
torture proved on a balance of probabilities, he should have disregarded it entirely  [93]. However, the 
judge did not need to and did not reach any conclusion that torture  had or had not been proved [94]. 
Even if the judge had reached a definite conclu sion that torture had not been proved on a balance of 
probabilities, there would have been no inconsistency between such a conclusion and the finding that torture was a real possibility that affected the reliance that should be placed on the confessions [95] . The 
facts that the court can take into account in assessing the weight to be given to hear say evidence in civil 
proceedings are not limited to facts proved to the civil standard of proof  [96]. While it is settled law that 
evidence  proved on a balance of probabilities to have been obtained by torture is inadmissible, there is 
no rule that  – if an allegation that torture was used is not proved to that standard – a possibility that 
evidence was obtained by torture must be ignored when deciding the facts in issue [106] -[108] .

The Supreme Court, Lord Reed (dubitante) concurring in the order, allows that appeal and makes an order 
requiring Dr Lehtimäki to vote in favour of the resolution  for the following reasons : 
 
Issue 1:  Dr Lehtimäki is a fiduciary when acting as a member of CIFF  
 
Lady Arden gives the sole judgment on this issue. The distinguishing characteristic of a fiduciary is that he 
owes a single- minded duty of loyalty in matters covered by his duty [44]. A member of a charitable company 
in principle owes this duty . A charitable company itself is analogous to a charitable tru stee, in the sense that 
it holds its assets subject to a binding obligation to apply them for charitable purposes only. The practical 
objection s to members being fiduciaries (with duties to make their own  investigations before voting and so 
on) are met by the fact that trust law allows such duties to be shaped by contract and in this case the members’ 
duties are shaped by the company’s constitution , as well as relevant legislation . So, the duty is essentially a 
contract- and-statute- based model [92]. The holding that a member is a fiduciary does not mean that there 
may not b e matters on which  a member can vote which only concern him personally and not the charity  
[101].  
 
Issue 2: The C ourt c an direct Dr Lehtimäki to vote in favour of the resolution  
 
Lord Briggs , with whom Lord Wilson  and Lord Kitchin agree, considers that o nce a court has decided 
whether a transaction is in the charity’s best interests , that question is finally resolved . The Chancellor was 
right that the member no longer has a free vote . The charity’s fiduciaries (whether or not parties) were obliged 
to use their powers to  ensure that the court’s decision  was implemented. It would be a plain breach of duty 
for a fiduciary not to follow that decision  [207 -208] . If the decision  was wrong , it could be appealed [210] . 
The concept that a fiduciary is entitled to form his own subjective judgment about a matter assumes that 
there are different conclusions about the matter which might reasonably be reached. This is no longer the 
case where a court has decided the issue [218] . If there was no such breach of duty, Lord Briggs agrees with 
Lady Arden that  this case constitute s an exceptional case in which the non- intervention principle does not 
apply  [217] . 
 
Lady Arden  holds  that this care is a rare exception to the non -intervention principle because of the existential 
threat to CIFF caused by the deeply felt dissension between the two founders  [137]. She rejects the majority’s 
analysis. The order approv ing the Grant did not give  jurisdiction to make an order directing Dr Lehtimäki to 
vote on the beach of duty basis  [180] . Moreover, a member’s duty is  subjective: Dr Lehtimäki did not threaten  
to breach  that duty . There are strong reasons of policy for the subjective approach to fiduciary duties and for 
the non-intervention principle, such as the policy of encourag ing persons to act as fiduciaries  [187]. The 
majority’s a nalysis  also means that members  are automatically in breach of duty if they fail to implement a 
transaction approved by the court at the trustees’ request, and this was contrary to the ethos of a membership 
charity, in which members who  desire to do more than give may  play a part in the direction of the charity. 
In addition , when the  vote is taken , circumstances may have changed [194] . 
 
Issue 3: Companies Act 2006 , s 217  does not prevent the court from directing a member to vote  
 
Lady Arden gives the sole judgment on this issue. Charities operate within a public law framework , where 
the court does not in general substitute its own judgment for that of the decisionmaker. However, s. 217’s purpose is to ensure adequate disclosure to, and approval by, the company’s members [159] , and the right to 
vote can be restricted by the company’s constitution or by orders made under the 2006 Act. In these circumstances, where the matter is internal to the charitable company, the court can in an appropriate case 
direct one of its members  how to vote [165].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The appellant appeals  on two issues: (1) whether, in respect of the type of communications used by the 
appellant and the PH group, article 8 rights may be interfered with by their use as evidence in a public 
prosecution of the appellant for a relevant offence; and  (2) the extent to which the obligation on the 
state, to provide adequate protection for article 8 rights, is incompatible with the use by a public 
prosecutor of material supplied  by PH groups in investigating and prosecuting crime  [11]. 
 
On the first issue, the appellant submits that there was an interference with the appellant’s right s to 
respect for his private life and his correspondence under article 8(1), which required the r espondent to 
show that such interference was justified under article 8(2)  [26]. The court holds  that there  was no 
interference with those rights at any stage  because : (i) the nature of the communications rendered them 
incapable of being  worth y of respect u nder article 8; and (ii) the appellant had no reasonabl e expectation 
of privacy in relation to the communications  [29]-[31].  
 
It is implicit in article 8(1) that the protected features of private life and correspondence must be capable 
of respect within the scheme of values the ECHR exists to protect and promote. States party to the ECHR have a special responsibility to protect children against sexual exploitation by adults [32] -[33]. 
Here,  in the absence of any state surveillance, and where the issue is the balance of the interests of a 
person engaging in such conduct and the children who are the recipients of the relevant communications, 
the reprehensible nature of the communic ations means they do not attract protection under article 8(1) 
[40]. The interests of children have priority over any interest a paedophile could have in being allowed 
to engage in criminal conduct. Further, the prohibition of the abuse of rights in articl e 17 of the ECHR 
supports the conclusion that the criminal conduct at issue in this case is not capable of respect for the 
purposes of article 8(1)  [41]-[43].  
 
An important indication of whether the right to respect for private life and correspondence is engaged 
is whether the individual had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to those communications , 
which is an objective question  [51]-[55]. The appellant’s communications were sent directly to the decoy . 
There was no prior re lationship between the appellant and recipient from which an expectation of 
privacy might be said to arise. Requests made by the appellant to the decoy to keep the communications 
private did not establish a relationship of confidentiality. Furthermore, the  appellant believed he was 
communicating with a 13- year-old child, who it was foreseeable might share any worrying 
communications with an adult [56] . The appellant may have enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy 
so far as the possibility of police sur veillance or intrusion by the wider public  are concerned , but not in 
relation to the recipient  [58]. Once the evidence had been passed on to the police, the appellant had no 
reasonabl e expectation that either the police or the respondent should treat them as confidential . Again, 
under the scheme of the ECHR, the effective prosecution of serious crimes committed in relation to children is part of the regime of deterrence a state must have in place [59] . 
 
On the second issue, the state had no supervening  positive obligation to protect the appellant’s interests 
that would prevent the respondent making use of the evidence to investigate or prosecute the crime. On 
the contrary, the relevant positive obligation on the respondent was to ensure that the crimina l law could 
be applied effectively to deter sexual offences against children. Article 8 has the effect that the 
respondent should be entitled to,  and might indeed be obliged to , make use of the evidence  in bringing 
a prosecution against him [64] .

 The Supreme Court  unanimously allows the appeal .  The leading judgment is given by Lord Reed, with 
whom Lady Black and  Lord Lloyd -Jones  agree. Lord Hodge  gives a separate judgment agree ing with the 
reasoning of Lord Reed . Lord Sales delivers a separate judgment, with which Lady Hale and Lord Kitchin 
agree , allowing the appeal on a wider  basis.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
After explaining  relevant  general principles of law  [2-13], and the background to the appeal [ 14-22], 
Lord Reed examines the de cisions  which are said to have established the “reflective loss” principle, 
namely Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd (No 2) [1982 ] Ch 204 [23-39] and Johnson v Gore 
Wood & Co [2002] 2 AC 1 [40-67]. He concludes that Prudential laid down a rule of company law : a 
diminution  in the value of a share holding  or in distributions to shareholders, which is merely the result 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 of a loss suffered by the company in consequence of a wrong done to it by the defendant, is not in the 
eyes of the law damage which is separate and distinct from the damage suffered b y the company , and is 
therefore not recoverable. The rule is based on the  rule in Foss v Harbottle (1843) 2 Hare 461, which 
would be subverted if the shareholder could pursue a personal action in those circumstances  [35-39]. 
That understanding of the rule is consistent with the speech of Lord Bingham in Johnson. Lord Millett’s 
speech, however, treated the “reflective loss” principle as a wider principle of the law of damages, b ased 
on the avoidance of double recovery [61 -63]. Lord Reed then reviews subsequent cases in which the 
“reflective loss” principle as explained by Lord Millett has developed , including Giles v Rhind  [2002] 
EWCA Civ 1428, Perry v Day [2004] EWHC 3372 (Ch) , and Gardner v Parker  [2004] EWCA Civ 781 [68-
77]. This examination  makes clear the need to distinguish “ (1) cases where claims are brought by a shareholder 
in respect of loss which he has suffered in that capacity, in the form of a diminution in share value or in distributions, wh ich 
is the conseq uence of loss sustained by the company, in respect of which the company has a cause of action against the same 
wrongdoer, and (2) cases where claims are brought, whether by a shareholder or by anyone else, in respect of loss which does not fall within that  description, but where the company has a right of action in respect of substantially the same loss ” [80]. 
The first kind of case is barred  by the rule in Prudential , regardless of whether the company recovers its 
loss in full [80-83]. In the second kind of case, recovery is permissible in principle, although it may be 
necessary to avoid double recovery [84-88].  
 
In light of this, Lord Reed holds that the reasoning in Johnson (other than that o f Lord Bingham) should 
be departed from, an d that Giles , Perry and Gardner were wrongly decided [ 89].  The rule in Prudential 
does not apply to Marex, which is a creditor of the Companies, not a shareholder [ 92].  
 
Lord Hodge agrees with Lord Reed’s reasons, noting that the panel was in agreement that the reflective 
loss principle has been expanded too greatly and would cause injustice if applied to Marex’s situation [95]. Lord Hodge also points out  the central  role of company law in the Court of Appeal’s judgment in 
Prudential , and how  the reflective loss principle’s departure from th ose foundations  has given rise to 
problems and uncertainties  in the law [ 95-108].  The bright line rule has a principled basis  in company 
law and ought not to be departed from now [109] . 
 Lord Sales  concludes that Marex’s appeal should be allowed, but for reasons differ ing from those of the 
majority  [116] . The majority see the reflective loss principle , per Prudential , to be a ru le of law deeming a 
shareholder’s loss by reduction in value of their shares or dividends to be irrecoverable where the 
company has a parallel claim. However,  in Lord Sales ’s view, Prudential did not lay down a rule that would 
exclude a shareholder’s recovery where, factually, the loss was different  from that of the company . The 
court in Prudential  set out reasoning why it thought  a shareholder  in such a  case had suffered no separate 
loss, but this is not sustainable  [117-118]. The governing principle  is indeed avoidance of double 
recovery , as was the view of the Law Lords in Johnson  (contra  Lord Reed)  [119].  
 
Lord Sales criticises  the authorities’ use of the word “ reflective ” as being  unhelpful . Although there is 
necessarily a relationship between a company ’s loss and the reduction in share  values  that it causes, “ the 
loss suffered by the shareholder is not the same as  the loss suffered by the company ” and there is no one -to-one 
corres pondence between the two [ 132]. The Court of Appeal in Prudential conflat ed the rationale for the 
rule in Foss v Harbottle  with that for the reflective loss principle  and assum ed that a personal action would 
subvert the rule.  That is not the case [ 142]. A shareholder ought not to be prevented from pursuing a 
valid personal cause of action; double recovery can be prevented by other means [ 149-155]. Lord Sales 
therefore questions the justification for the reflective loss principle and whether it should still be 
recognised [194]. Even if the principle is accepted, it should not be extended to cover a case involving 
loss suffered by a creditor of the company. There are better ways to avoid double recovery in such a situation, such as by according the wrongdoer a right of subrogation to the extent he pays the creditor sums in respect of the debt owed by the company [198 -205].

By a majority, t he Supreme Court  dismisses th e appeal.  Lord Sales  gives the lead  judgment , with which 
Lord Kerr agrees. Lady Black gives a concurring judgment. Lord Wilson gives a dissenting judgment, with which Lady Hale agrees.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 In the lead judgment, Lord Sales sets out the  four issues that arise on the appeal: (1) whether under 
section 27 an English court has jurisdiction to make any order for maintenance in a case with no international dimension; (2) if so, whether Schedule 6 allows for an  English court to retain its previous  
discretion t o stay maintenance proceedings before it on the ground of forum non conveniens  (ie the 
court’s discretion to make an assessment as to which jurisdiction is the most appropriate) ; (3) if not, 
whether the purported removal of that discretion was outside the scope of the Secretary of State’s powers in section 2(2) of the ECA 1972; and (4) if not, whether the husband’s divorce proceeding in Scotland 
is a “related action” for the purposes of article 13 of the Maintenance Regulation and the corresponding 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 provisio n in Schedule 6 and , accordingly , whether  the English court should decline jurisdiction in respect 
of the wife’s claim for a maintenance order under section 27  [7]. 
 
Lord Sales considers that the European Union (“ EU”) legislation governing jurisdiction in cross -border 
cases  treats  maintenance obligations and questions of marital status, including divorce, as separate 
matters for the purposes of jurisdiction  [8]-[24]. Maintenance obligations are covered by their own 
inter-state jurisdiction r egime  set out  in the Maintenance Regulation  [17]. Schedule 6 applies the 
provisions of the Maintenance Regulation to the allocation of jurisdiction for intra -state cases within the 
United Kingdom relating  to maintenance  [22]-[23]. 
 
On the first issue,  the husband  submits  that section 27 can only apply if a case falls to be governed by 
both the Maintenance Regulation and by Schedule 6, which would have the effect of it only applying in 
inter-state cases . Lord Sales considers (and Lord Wilson agree s) that section 27 does not require  that 
both the Maintenance Regulation and Schedule 6 apply . Section 27 refers to both the Maintenance 
Regulation and Schedule 6 only in the sense that together they cover the whole possible field of inter -
state cases and intra -state cases  [26], [135] -[140] .  
 
On the second issue,  Lord Sales follows EU case law to hold that the scheme of the EU legislation is 
inconsistent with the courts of a Member State retaining any discretionary power to stay proceedings on forum non conveniens grounds [28] . This is particularly applicable to the Maintenance Regulation,  
which aims to afford special protection to a maintenance creditor by giving him or her the right to 
choose jurisdiction [29] . Schedule 6 replicates the scheme of the Maintenance Regulation in domestic 
law for intra -state cases , and accordingly has the effect of removing any discretion based on the domestic 
forum non conveniens doctrine  [34].  
 On the third issue, Lord Sales considers  (and Lord Wilson agree s) that the making of the 2011 
Regulations is within the wide power conferred on the Secretary of State by  section 2(2) of the ECA 
1972 to make subordinate legislation  [38], [141]-[145] . 
 On the fourth issue, i n Lord Sales’s judgment the husband’s divorce proceeding in Scotland is not a 
“related ac tion” within article 13 of the Maintenance Regulation , so that article (and the corresponding 
provision in Schedule 6) does not permit the English court to decline jurisdiction  [40]. The Maintenance 
Regulation must be considered in light of its fundamental  object of confer ring the right to choose 
jurisdiction  on a maintenance creditor  [41]. The word “actions” in article 13 refers primarily to 
maintenance claims to which the special regime in the Regulation applies.  Holding it to mean  any legal 
proceedings  would undermine the object of the Regulation [45]. There is no relevant connection 
betw een the wife’s section 27 maintenance claim in England  and the Scottish proceedings concerned 
with determining marriage status  [46]. 
 In her concurring judgment, Lady Black agrees with Lord Sales’s conclusion  on article 13, despite the 
fact that it  leads t o the potential fragmentation of the proceedings required to resolve financial affairs 
upon divorce . Based  on the wording of article 13, with the  object of protecting the maintenance creditor  
in mind , she considers that the English and the Scottish proceedings are not related actions  [91]. 
 In his dissenting judgment , Lord Wilson views  the English and Scottish proceedings as  “related actions” 
for the purpose of article 13 , giving the English court the power to stay or decline the wife’s maintenance 
application.  He would adopt a broad, common sense approach to the interpretation of the article [162] . 
As a result, Lord Wilson  would have allowed the husband’s appeal [163] .

The Supreme Court  unanimously  allows the appeal . It holds that the questions certified do not arise on 
the present appeal because a determination under s. 160A was not made. Lord Kerr gives the judgment.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 provides for two stages to confiscation proceedings: the first is the 
making of the confiscation order itself and the second the order securing its enforcement. The first stage 
is dealt with  in section s 156 and 163B and envisages that the making  of a confiscation orde r should be 
straightforward, indeed quasi -automatic [ 8]. Section  160A  of the A ct provides that  
(1) Where it appears to a court making a confiscation order that  
(a) there is property held by the defendant that is likely to be realised or otherwise used to satisfy the order, and  
(b) a person other than the defendant holds, or may hold, an interest in the property, the court may, if it thinks 
it appropriate to do s o, determine the extent (at the time the confiscation order is made) of the defendant’s 
interest in the property.  
(2) The court must not exercise the power conferred by subsection (1) unless it gives to anyone who the court thinks 
is or may be a person holdin g an interest in the property a reasonable opportunity to make representations to it.  
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 (3) A determination under this section is conclusive in relation to any question as to the extent of the defendant’s 
interest in the property that arises in connection with -  
(a) the realisation of the property, or the transfer of an interest in the property, with a view to satisfying the 
confiscation order, or  
(b) any action or proceedings taken for the purposes of any such realisation or transfer.  
The critical question is whether , at the stage of making  the order,  the Crown Court judge  made a 
determin ation of the extent of Ms Hilton’s interest in the jointly owned property under section 160A . If 
made on foot of such a determination , the confiscation order  becomes immutable unless there is an appeal 
[11-14]. A determination under s. 160A therefore effectively extinguishes the opportunity for third parties 
to make later representations.  On the other hand, the judge can  at this stage  form a view  of the extent 
of the interest of the person in question, here Ms Hilton, without  making a determination under s. 160A.   
Parliament intended this to be the case, as  is evident from the provisions relating to the second, 
enforcement stage  of a confiscation order [ 14]. In particular, s . 199(8) provides that a court must not 
order enforcement unless it gives persons holding interests in the property a reasonable opportunity to 
make representations. This section is important because it was ret ained in the legislation despite the 
introduction of section 160A. Furthermore, subsection 8B  to s. 199 proceeds on the premise that s. 
160A and s.  199 continue, in relevant circumstances, to co- exist [16-18]. Reading these sections together, 
it is clear that s . 160A does not purport to occupy the field. The opportunity to make representations at 
the enforcement stage continues to apply either because a determination under s.  160A has not been 
made or because th e conditions in s. 199(8B) are met. The fundamental point is that, at the enforcement 
stage, third party rights may continue to be considered  [18]. 
Essentially, therefore, where the court makes a s. 160A determination, third parties must be afforded the 
chance to make representations at the stage of making  the confiscation order , as provided for by s. 
160A(2) . But w here the court does not  make a s. 160A determination and  rather simply forms a view , at 
this first stage  of the process,  of the extent of the interest of the person in question, it will have to give 
third parties the chance to make representations at the enforcement  stage. Where the court does not make 
a s. 160A determination , therefore, it is not incumbent upon it to give third parties the chance to make 
representations at the first stage  of the process (the making of the order) because they will have the 
chance to do so at the second stage (enforcement) before the confiscation order is enforced.  
The Court of Appeal’s judgm ent is premised on the proposition that on every occasion that third party 
interests arise, the court must proceed under section 160A. This is contrary to the conclusion reached 
that the introduction of s. 160A has not modified the opportunity available to the Crown Court to make 
a confiscation order other than  under s. 160A. The consequence of the Court of Appeal’s  approach would 
involve a  collapse of the traditional two stages  – the making of an order and the enforcement of it –  into 
one hearing with all the panoply of investigation of the merits of the rights of third parties, such as a former partner and the building society in the present appeal. This would inevitably introduce a cumbersome procedure to the making of the confiscation orde r [23]. 
This was not intended . The making of a confiscation order would no longer be straightforward, much 
less quasi -automatic ( see para [8]) if s.  160A had to be applied in all its rigour in every case where third -
party interests arose  [24]. The enactment of the sect ion was designed to streamline the system, not to 
complicate  it. S. 160A simply introduces a procedure allowing third parties to make repr esentations at 
the confiscation stage, but only  where the Crown Court makes a determination  under s. 160A [ 27]. No 
determination under s. 160A was made here [ 28]. For this reason, the answer to the questions certified 
is that the y do not arise on the present appeal. The appeal is therefore allowed  [29].

 The Supreme Court unanimously di smisses the appeal . Lord Leggatt give s the sole judgment .  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 The fi rst obstacle facing the taxpayer was the time limit in section 80 of the VAT Act, which applie d to 
recovery of money paid that was not “ VAT due to HMRC ”. To avoid t he time li mit, the taxpayer 
there fore had to argue  that all the tax paid on a game by game basis in the years 1996- 2004 was due to 
HMRC  [24]. The taxpayer  argued  that both the session by session and game by ga me methods we re 
legitimate methods of calculation. As such, when using the game by g ame method , it was paying tax 
that was due and therefore section 80 of the VAT Act , and its time limit,  did not apply [27].  
 Lord  Leggatt disagreed; there was only one correct method of calculating the taxable element –  which 
was the session by session me thod [30]. In the present case, it was an agreed fact that a customer 
purchase d a right to participate in a session of bingo [38]. No reason was advanced for goin g behind 
the pricing policy adopted by the taxpayer [39]. It followed that if , as a result of using the game by 
game basis , the taxpayer had paid more VAT to HMRC between 1996 and 2007 than if it ha d used the  
session by session method , then the taxpayer had paid tax that was not due . This means that section 80 
with its three year time limit  applied , so that VAT paid before 2004 cannot be recovered [41] .  
 
This was sufficient to dispose of the appeal . However, Lord Leggatt w ent o n to address the rest of the 
taxpayer’s argume nt. The taxpayer  sought repayment by relying on article 90 of the Principal V AT 
Directive, which states “ In the case of cancellation, refusal or total or partial non -payment, or where the price is 
reduced afte r the supply takes place, the taxable amount shall be r educed accordingly under conditions which shall be 
determined by the member states ”. The mechanism for adjustments under article 90 is found in regulation 
38 of the 1995 Regulations , which  applies where there is an increase or “ a decrease in consideration fo r a 
supply ”. There i s no time limit for making such adjustments [45]. The taxpayer argued that where the 
method of calculation chang es and produce s a lower amount, there is a reduction in the  price / 
decrease in consideration fo r a supply  for which an adjustment can be made under regulation 38 [46].  
 
Lord Leggatt reject ed that argument  [47]. Article 90 and regulation 38 apply only where the re has been 
a change in the consideration a ctually  received by the taxpayer , not where  all that has change d is the 
method used to calculate the taxable amount [4 8]. It would subvert  section 80 of the VAT Act if the 
taxable person could , by adopting a differ ent method of calculation , adjust its liability for all past year s.   
 
The taxpayer  further  argued that the business  brief required or invited bingo promoters  to change the 
calculation  method and make retros pective adjustments accordingly [57] . This was a lso not accepted. 
HMRC does not general ly have the power to issue binding guidance [59]  and the business brief was 
merely  HMRC’s vie w of the law ; if the taxpayer disagree d, the position  would need to be resolved by a 
tribunal  [60]. In any case , the business brief could only reasonably be read as inviting bingo promoters 
who found that they had incorrectly calculated VAT on a game  by game basis  to make a claim f or 
repay ment under section 80 [64]. It could not be read  as inviting promoters to make adjustment s 
under regulation 38 [65] . The business brief  was therefore  inconsistent with the ta xpayer ’s case [67].

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 A patent reflects a bargain between th e inventor  and the public . The inventor gains  a time -limited 
monopoly over the  making and use of a product . In return, t he public gains the ability to make the 
product after the expiry of the monopoly . As part of this bargain, the inventor  must publish sufficient 
information  to enable a skilled member of the public to make the product.  This ensures that patent 
holders only gain legal protection which is proportional to  their actual technical contribution to the art, 
and encourages inventors to conduct research for the benefit of society [23] . 
 
The Court of Appeal was influenced by the fact that Regeneron’s invention is a principle of general 
application . Its contribution to the field was present not only in mice which could be made  in 2001, but 
also in mice with a larger amount of human genetic material which could be made using later  scientific 
development s. The Court of Appeal thought it was unfair to limit Regeneron’s monopoly to types of 
hybrid mice which could be made when the patent was filed  [27]. 
 
However, the authorities establish a number of principles in this area . Patentees  must not make overly 
broad claims [56(iii)] . If they claim the right to make a range of products, sufficiency means they must 
disclose enough information to enable a skilled person to make the full range which is claimed [56(iv)] . 
This means a relevant range which affects the utility of the product [56(vii)] . So Regeneron was not 
required to explain how to make mice of varying colours, or with tails of varying length, because these 
features do not affect a mouse’s ability to produce antibodies [21] . 
 Applying these principles, Regeneron’s patents did not enable a skilled person to make mice containing 
more than a very small section  of the human variable region. The amount of human material  was an 
important factor which was thought to affect the diversity of useful antibodies whi ch the mice would 
produce . Mice at the more valuable end of the range could not be made using Regeneron’s patents . So 
Regeneron was claiming a monopoly which was far wider than its contribution to the art [57] . 
 The Court of Appeal  upheld patents over a range of mice  even though Regeneron could only make mice  
over a small part of the range, at the least beneficial end of the range  with the smallest amount of human 
genetic material [58] . Its analysis watered down the sufficiency requirement which is a bedr ock of patent 
law, tilting the balance of patent law in favour of patentees and against the public [59] . Therefore, the 
majority allows the  appeal and holds that the patents are invalid for insufficiency.  
 Lady Black gives a dissenting judgment, in substance agreeing with  the Court of Appeal . The application 
of the sufficiency requirement depends on the nature of the individual invention and the facts of the 
case. The Court of Appeal characterised Regeneron’s invention as a principle of general application 
which solved the problem of immunological sickness [ 83-84]. Seen in this way, the sufficiency 
requirement was met since the invention was d eployed in each mouse across the range, irrespective of 
the quantum of human material incorporated  [86].

The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses  the appeal s. Lady Hale and Lord Hodge give  the sole judgment with 
which the other Justices agree . The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JU DGM ENT  
 
The Supreme Court considers  that article 8 of the ECHR provides the appropriate framework for analysis . 
The requirement of a fair hearing under article 6 does not  add anything to that right in the present 
circumstances [27]. In each case, t he relev ant interest for the purposes of article 8 is  the maintenance and 
development of the relation ship between the sibling  and the referred child [29]. In the context of a 
children’s hearing , respect is shown to that interest if, in the particular circumstances  of the case, the sibling 
is enabled to have an involvement in the decision -making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to 
protect that interest  [30]. The required degree of involvement will vary based on the nature and extent of 
the sibling ’s relationship with the refe rred child . 
 
The Supreme Court concludes  that a rticle 8 does not require public authorities to grant relevant person  
status to a sibling, who does  not have , and has not recently had, a significant involvement in the upbringing 
of the child [51]. Whilst the guidance has not always been clear, there is a range of measures which can be  
used to ensure that the relevant public authorities comply with their duty to act compatibly with the article 
8 rights of family members  who are n ot relev ant persons  [41]. For instance,  the Scottish Children’s 
Reporter Administration  directs  reporters, when arranging a hearing, to consider whether there is anyone 
other than a (deemed) relevant person who ought  to be invited under the discretionary powers  contained in 
section 7 8 of the 2011 Act  [32]. Children ’s hearings also have recourse to  advice from the National 
Convener of Children's Hearings Scotland , who would advise against refusing to obtain the views of a 
sibling of sufficient age and maturity [33]. Further guidance is provided in Children’s Hearings Scotland’s 
Practice and Procedure Manual , which directs  children ’s hearings to  obtain  information about a child’s 
relationships with siblings and to give careful consideration to how these relationsh ips can be maintained 
and protected [ 35].  
 
Under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 and the Looked After Children (Scotland) Regulations 2009 , the 
responsible local autho rity must  obtain details of  the child’s siblings and their contact with the child and 
prepare a “child’s plan”  with arrangements for contact between the child and others [36]. In addition, t he 
Principal Reporter, who is respon sible for investigating whether a CSO is nece ssary , may  require the local 
authority to provide a report or further in form ation about  a child, including  relevant information about the 
child’ s siblings [37]. The child or any  relevant person may also  make representations on beha lf of the 
child’ s wider family, including siblings [ 39]. Taken together, these mechanisms allow children’s hearings to  
show respect for the family life of those  who are not entitled to the status of relevant person  [38], provided 
that hearings are conducted in a practical and sensible manner and in line  with the guidance of  the Principal 
Reporter and Children’s Hearings Sco tland  [41]. 
 As such, t he Supreme Court h olds that the relevant provision s of the 2011 Act  are within the competence 
of the Scottish  Parliament and need not be read down  [50, 51]. Those who have a significant involvement 
in the upbringing of a  child are those who make decisions for the child.  Relevant person status is granted to 
such persons because CSO s interfere with their right s to make such decisions  [46]. A sibling, who has not 
taken on such responsibility and does not face such interference, should  not be given relevant person  
status . It would not be appropriate for every sibling to be required to attend all the children ’s hearing s 
under pain of criminal sanction  [47], or to have  comprehensive access to the referred child’s docum ents 
(which might include highly sensitive information  about the child and other family members ) [48], or to 
have the power to delay or  disrupt referrals by w ithholding  their agreement to the underlying grounds  [47]. 
Nor would this be consistent with  the s tatutory requirement for children ’s hearings to minimise the 
number of people  present at any given time [50].

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal  and dismisses Lonsdale’s cross -appeal , with the result 
that the adjudication can go ahead . Lord Briggs gives the only judgment.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 (1) The jurisdiction point  
 The Supreme Court concludes  that the adjudicator does have jurisdiction.  
 The insolvency set -off between Bresco’s claim and Lonsdale’s cross -claim does not mean that there is 
no longer a dispute under the construction contract , or that the claim s have simply melted away  [47]. 
The cl aims maintained their separate identity for many purposes [29] . Despite insolvency set -off, Bresco 
could have brought court proceedings to determine the value of its claim , or exercise d a contractual right 
to go to arbitration [50- 51]. It follows that Bresco could also refer its claim to adjudication [52]. 
 (2) The futility point  
 The Court of Appeal thought there was a basic incompatibility between adjudication and insolvency set -
off. If the adjudicator found in favour of Bresco, the co urts would refuse to enforce the award because 
it would interfere with the insolvency process . The adjudication would not promote the goal of “pay 
now, argue later”: it was futile and a waste of resources [ 54-56]. 
 The Supreme Court rejects that view [58] . Bresco  has a statutory and contractual right to adjudication. 
It would ordinarily be inappropriate for the court to interfere with the exercise of that statutory and 
contractual right  [59]. 
 
Maintaining cash flow i s not the only purpose of adjudication under the 1996 Act. Adjudication was 
designed to be  a method of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in its own right. In reality m ost decisions 
of an adjudicator are never challenged in court and they lead to a speed y, cost effective and final 
resolution of the dispute [13 -15]. Here  an adjudication will be a simple, proportionate method for 
Bresco’s liquidators to determine the net balance  [60-62]. It is possible that the courts will not grant 
summary enforcement of t he adjudicator’s decision due to the insolvency process, but that does not 
deprive the adjudication of its potential usefulness to the liquidators [64- 67].

Visa and Mastercard  appeal on four grounds. First, whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to find that 
there was a restriction of competition in the acquiring market contrary to article 101(1) TFEU and 
equivalent national legislation (“ the restriction issue ”). Second, whether  the Court of Appeal found, 
and if so was it wrong in finding, that Visa and Mastercard  were required to satisfy a more onerous 
evidential standard than that normally applicable in civil litigation, in order to establish that their MIFs 
were exempt under a rticle 101(3) (“ the standard of proof issue ”). Third, whether the Court of Appeal 
was wrong to find that in order to show that consumers receive a fair share of the benefits generated by the MIFs, to satisfy the test under article 101(3), Visa was required  to prove that the benefits provided 
to merchants alone as a result of the MIFs outweighed the costs arising from the MIFs, without taking any account of the benefits received by cardholders as a result of the MIFs (“ the fair share issue ”). 
Fourth, whether  the Court of Appeal found and , if so, was it wrong in finding, that a defendant has to 
prove the exact amount of loss mitigated in order to reduce damages (“ the broad axe issue ”). Finally, 
AAM seek to cross- appeal on the issue of whether the Court of Appe al was wrong to remit the AAM 
proceedings for reconsideration in relation to exemption under article 101(3) (“ the remission issue ”) 
[40]-[41].

The restriction issue  
 
The restriction issue raises two issues for consideration: (i) whether the Co urt is bou nd by the Mastercard 
CJ decision; and (ii) if not, whether that decision ought to be followed [48] . The appellants argue that 
the Court of Appeal was wrong to conclude that it was bound by Mastercard  CJ to find that there was a 
restriction of competition i n the acquiring market contrary to article 101(1) TFEU and equivalent 
national legislation because Mastercard  CJ is factually distinguishable [68] -[72]. The Supreme Court 
concludes that Mastercard CJ is binding and the Court of Appeal was correct so to hol d. The essential 
factual basis upon which the Court of Justice held that there was a restriction on competition in Mastercard  CJ is mirrored in these appeals [93] -[94]. Even if the C ourt were not bound by Mastercard CJ, 
the Supreme Court would follow it and conclude that there was a restriction on competition in the present cases.  T he effect of the collective agreement  to set the MIF is to fix a minimum price floor for 
the MSC. That minimum or reservation price is non- negotiable. Acquirers have no incentive to compete 
over it. It is a known common cost which acquirers know they can pass on in full and do so. Merchants have no ability to negotiate it down. A significant portion of the MSC is thereby immunised from 
competitive bargaining and is determined by collective agreement rather than by competition. By 
contrast , in the counterfactual, in which there is no MIF but se ttlement at par, the whole of the MSC is 
open to competitive bargaining and determined by competition  [95]-[104]. The C ourt therefore 
dismisses the appeal on the restriction issue [105] .  
 
The standard of proof issue  
 
On the standard of proof issue, the ap pellants submit that the Court of Appeal was wrong to conclude 
that, in relation to article 101(3), there is a specific requirement for robust and cogent evidence, which 
is a more onerous standard than the normal domestic civil standard of proof on the bal ance of 
probabilities, and that there is a legal requirement for facts and empirical data [106] . It is common ground 
that to justify the restriction on competition the burden of satisfying that the four conditions set out in article 101(3) lies on the defe ndant; the present issue relates to the standard of proof [107] . Visa and 
Mastercard  submit that in the Commercial Court proceedings the judges adopted diverging views on the 
standard of proof  [108] . The Court of Appeal considered that EU law requires coge nt factual and 
empirical evidence to satisfy article 101(3) [109] .  
 
The Court considers that the essential complaint made by Visa and Mastercard  here does not relate to 
the standard of proof but rather to the nature of the evidence required to meet the st andard of proof in 
this context and , more specifically, the type of evidence needed to establish that the benefits from the 
MIF rules under consideration outweigh the detriments to merchants [115] . In the C ourt’s view, article 
101(3) imposes requirements a s to the nature of the evidence that can discharge the burden to establish 
an exemption under that provision, which is imported into domestic competition law by the 1998 Act. 
Cogent empirical evidence is required to carry out the required evaluation of the  claimed efficiencies and 
benefits [116] . The C ourt therefore dismisses the appeal on the standard of proof issue [138] . 
 The fair share issue  
 On the fair share issue, Visa challenges the decision of the Court of Appeal, which interpreted Mastercard  
CJ as meaning that in a two -sided market situation such as in the present case, if the restriction causes 
disadvantages overall to the consumers in the market under consideration (here the merchants in the acquiring market), those disadvantages cannot be com pensated by advantages to consumers in the other 
market (the cardholders in the issuing market), unless the two groups of consumers are substantially the 
same, which is not the position here [144] . The Supreme Court finds that the Court of Appeal arrived 
at the correct decision, albeit by different reasoning. The best available guidance from the CJEU on the 
application of the fair share requirement is the opinion of the Advocate General Mengozzi in Mastercard  
CJ, which considered that the fair share of the benefits must be received by the consumers in the same 
market. The C ourt therefore dismisses the appeal on the fair share issue [171] -[174] .

The broad axe issue  
 
The broad axe issue relates to the degree of precision required in the quantification of mi tigation of loss 
where a defendant to a claim for damages arising out of a breach of competition law asserts that the 
claimant has mitigated its loss through the passing on of all or part of an overcharge to its customers 
[175] . Mastercard  submitted that i t must prove that the merchants passed on some of the overcharge to 
their customers but the quantification of the pass -on did not have to be precise if precision could not 
reasonably be achieved [179] . The claims of the merchants in these appeals are for c ompensatory 
damages for loss caused to them by the tortious acts of Visa and Mastercard  in breach of their statutory 
obligations under the 1998 Act [182] . In such circumstances, EU law allows a member state to lay down 
procedural rules governing actions that safeguard rights derived from EU law, provided the rules comply with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. The only constraint on national law at the relevant 
time was the principle of effectiveness, which requires that the domestic rules do not make it practically 
impossible or excessively difficult to exercise rights guaranteed by EU law [188] .  
 In the UK, pass -on is an element in the quantification of damages that is required by the compensatory 
principle and required to prevent double rec overy through claims in respect of the same overcharge by 
a direct purchaser and by subsequent purchasers in a chain [196] -[197] . Visa and Mastercard  have the 
burden of establishing that the merchants have recovered the costs incurred in the MSC but, once the defendants have raised the issue of mitigation, in the form of pass -on, there is a heavy evidential burden 
on the merchants to provide evidence [216] . The degree of precision requires a balance between 
achieving justice by precisely compensating the cl aimant and dealing with disputes at a proportionate 
cost [217] . The law does not require unreasonable precision in the proof of the amount of the loss that 
the merchants have passed on to suppliers and customers [225] . The Supreme Court does not interpret 
the Court of Appeal as having held that the defendants had to prove the exact amount of the loss mitigated, but insofar as the Court of Appeal required a greater degree of precision in the quantification of pass -on from Visa and Mastercard  than from the me rchants, the C ourt erred. As a result, the appeal 
succeeds on the broad axe issue [226] . 
 The remission issue  
 The cross -appeal relates only to the AAM proceedings [227] . AAM submit that the Court of Appeal 
erred in remitting the AAM proceedings for recons ideration of the exemption under article 101(3). 
Despite reaching the correct conclusion that Mastercard ’s defence based on article 101(3) should have 
been dismissed, the Court of Appeal made an order remitting the AAM proceedings to the CAT, alongside the  other two sets of proceedings, for reconsideration of whether Mastercard ’s case under 
article 101(3) should have succeed ed in whole or in part  [232] -[233] . AAM submit that it was not open 
to the Court of Appeal to so order and to permit the issue to be re -opened by Mastercard , and that it 
offended against the principle of finality in litigation [235] . In the Supreme Court’s judgment, the Court 
of Appeal was  wrong to allow Mastercard  to re-open this issue, which it had lost after a full and fair trial. 
It offends against the strong principle of public policy and justice that there should be finality in litigation [237] . Accordingly, AAM’s cross -appeal is allo wed [247] .

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Unfair trial  
 The Court of Appeal was correct to treat the claimant’s allegation as being that the trial had been unfair, 
not that the judge had g iven the appearance of bias against him . For it is far from clear that an informed 
and fair -minded observer would consider that the judge had given that appearance  [39]. The authorities 
on an inquiry into the unfairness of a trial establish  the following principles : a judge’s interventions 
should be as infrequent as possibl e during  cross- examination  of witness es, and he must  remain  above 
the fray and neutral while evidence  is being elicited ; the quality of the written judgment cannot re nder a 
trial fair in circumstances where  the judge’s  interventions at the hearing prejudiced the exploration of 
evidence ; and where a transcript exists, it is not the present practice of high er courts to invite the judge 
to comment on the allegations , but the fact that he is unable to comment  requires th ose courts to  analyse  
the evidence  with great care [ 40-45]. Unrepresented litigants  are unlikely to be equipped to withstand 
judicial pressure and so  the judge  must temper his conduct accordingly [46] . 
 
The factual analysis of the conduct of the trial i s set out  in the schedule to Lord Wilson’s judgment  [47]. 
It is important to remember (among other things) that the excerpts from the transcript  which are 
reproduced there  were separated by long stretches of evidence in respect of which no criticism of the 
judge can be made. But the transcripts do nevertheless show that the  judge directed a “barra ge of 
hostility” towards the claimant’s case and towards the claimant himself acting in person. In doing so the 
judge  used “immoderate, ill- tempered and at times offensive language”. The Court is driven  to uphold 
the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the j udge did not allow the claim to be properly presented; that 
therefore he could not fairly appraise it; and that the trial was unfair . Instead of making allowance for 
the claimant’s being unrepresented , the judge “ harassed and intimidated him ” [48]. 
 
The lo gical consequence of a conclusion that a trial was unfair is an order for a complete retrial. So it is 
hard to understand the Court of Appeal’s order that all the issues relating to the determination of  whether 
the defendants were liable to the claimant ha d been concluded . Conscious that the  justice system has 
failed both sides , the Court , with deep regret,  must order a full retrial [49] . 
 
Public interest  defence  
 
The House of Lords’ decision in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd  [2001] 2 AC 127 established  the existence 
at common law of a specific defence to a  claim for defamation brought  in relation to publication of a 
statement on a matter of public interest.  Where the defamatory material  concerned such a matter , the 
defendant  had to show that it had met the standard of  “responsible journalism” , measured by reference 
to a list of ten factors [53- 56]. Section 4 of the Act r eplaced th e “Reynolds  defence ” with a new  defence  
which , on any view , draws on the principles in Reynolds  and later cases  [58, 68- 69]. The section 4 defence  
is available where the defendant  “reasonably believed that publishing the statement complained of was 
in the public interest” (s.4(1)(b))  [52, 62] . In assessing reasonableness, the Court must  (among other 
things) “have regard to all the circumstances of the case”  (s.4(2))  [52, 65] . Refer ence to the Reynolds  
factors was deliberately omitte d from the section  [62, 69]. 
 
The Court of Appeal  was wrong to  state that the Reynolds  defence and the s ection 4 defence are not 
materially different : for t he elements of the two cannot be equated  [68, 72]. It was also inappropriate  
for the Court of Appeal  to regard the Reynolds  factors as a “check list” in the context of s ection 4  [69, 
77]. For these and other reasons, t he new judge should determine whether the public interest defence is 
available to th e defendants  without reference to the Court of Appeal’s reasoning on section 4 [78] .

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 Expressions in the Treaty such as “salaries, wages and other remuneration”, “employment” and “enterprise” should be given their ordinary meaning unless domestic legislation alters the meaning which they would otherwise have [18; 30] .  
 Section 15 of ITTOIA  provides that a person who would otherwise be taxed as an employee is “instead 
treated” as self -employed for the purposes of domestic income tax. Deeming provisions of this kind 
create a “statutory fiction” which should be followed as far as required for the purposes for which the 
fiction was created. T he courts will recognise the consequences of that fiction being real, but not where 
this will produce unjust, absurd or anomalous results [27]. 
 Although s ection 15 use s the expressions “income”, “employment ” and “trade”, it does not alter the 
meaning of those terms  but takes the ir ordinary meaning as the starting point for a statutory fiction [31 -
32]. Properly understood, it taxes the income of an employed diver  in a particular manner which includes 
the fiction that the diver is carrying on a trade . That fiction is not created for the purpose of rendering 
a qualifying diver immune from tax in the UK , or for adjudicating between the UK and South Africa as 
potential recipients of tax , but to adjust the basi s of a continuing UK income tax liability  [33]. 
 Since t he Treaty is not concerned with the manner in which taxes are levied , it would be contrary to the 
purposes of the Treaty to redefine its scope by reference to ITTOIA . It would also be contrary to the 
purpose of ITTOIA and would produce an anomalous result [33- 34].

The Supre me Court unanimously dismisse s the app eals. Lord Carnwath gives the sole judgment, with 
which the other Justices agree.  
 REASONS  FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 There are two aspects to the argument of whether the sites of the ATMs are capable of identification 
as sepa rate heredi taments [28]. First, with r egard to the 2000 Regulations, the statutory assumption 
that certain plant ( e.g. ATMs) has no effect on ratea ble value applies only to the valuation  of the 
hereditament. It does not follow that this applies to the logi cally prior  question of wh ether there is a 
hereditament that needs to be valued [33] . Second, previous case law establishes that a hereditament is 
a self-contained piece of property (i.e. property all parts of which are physically accessible from all 
other  parts, wit hout having to go onto othe r property) [34]. The Up per Tribunal was  entitled to find 
that there should be no diff iculty in defining  the bo undaries of fixed ATM s so as to satisfy the 
geographical test for self -containment [35], with t he exception  is the mov eable ATM,  which , as the y 
found , had the qualities of “impermanence and mobility ” [39]. 
 The second  question is w hether the retaile rs or the banks were in r ateable occupation of  the ATMs 
[40]. A lodging house, which is treated as a single heredi tament in t he occupat ion of the landlord , is a 
useful example. While the landlord’s  control of the premises does not interfe re with, and indee d 
supports, the enjoyment by the lodgers of their own rooms for their own purposes, there is still only 
one heredi tament in t he occupat ion of the landlord [46] . On the facts the Upper Tribunal held that the 
retailers ' retain ed occupation of the ATM sites  but had conferred on the banks rights which 
substantially restricted the retailers’ use of those sites. This was be cause the p resence of  the ATMs

with an  income [48]. Both the parties derived a direc t benefit from the use of the site s for the same 
purpose  and sha red the economi c fruits o f the activity for which  the space was  used. This is sufficient 
to support the conclusi on that the inte rnal ATMs remained  in the occupation of the retailers [49]. 
 External ATMs are to be treated the same as internal ones.  That an external ATMs i s availabl e to a 
wider marker at all times, and is  physically separated from the other facilities  in the st ores, does not 
detract f rom the Upper Tribunal’s  finding that the ret ailers remained in occupation of the ATM s, nor 
that they were any les s a part of  the retai lers’ businesses. The difference is no greater than the 
difference between an internal or external ATM in a bank building . Thus, the external ATMs remained 
in the rat eable occupation of the retailers  [52].

REASONS FOR T HE JUDGMENT  
 
Whether listing is conclusive of the i tems being “buildings” for the purposes of the Listed Buildings Act  
 
It is a principle that individuals affected by a legal measure should have a fair opportunity to challenge 
the measure and to vindicate  their rights in court proceedings. In applying this pr inciple, the context of 
the particular  statutory scheme in question is relevant [20] . In the parallel context of breach of 
planning control, the statutory gro unds of appeal are so wide that they incl ude every aspect of the 
merits of the decision to serve  an enforcement notice. It is hard to see why it should be any different 
in the context of a listed building enforcement notice. Indeed, the question of whether  something is a 
“building” may raise diff icult issues of factual judgment  which an inspector appointed und er the 
statutory scheme is more appropriately placed to  decide than the High Court on  judicial review [22] .  
 
Under the statutory scheme a listed buil ding means “a building which is… included  in [the] list”. It is 
an essential element that the th ing in issue be a “ building ”. If it is not in truth a “ building ” at all, there 
is nothing to say that the mere inclusion in the list will make it otherwise. Sec tion 7 prohibits the 
demolition of a “ listed building ”, and s.9(1) makes contravention of that p rohibition a criminal 
offence. But there is nothing to prevent the accused arguing that the item demolished is not a “building” and so not within the definition [24]. As such, the question of whether t he thing listed is in 
fact a building can be considered  by the inspector on a statutory appeal [25] . The enforcement appeal 
must be remitted to the First Respondent for redetermination [26] . The application for list ed building 
consent  can be  dealt with by agr eement [27].  
 The relevant test for a “building”  
 There is a need for general guidance on the legal principles in play in determining whether something 
constitutes a “building ” [28]. In Skerritts of Nottingham v  Secretary of State for the Environment T ransport and 
Regions [2000] JPL 1025 a three -fold test was adopted considering size, permanence and degree of 
physical attachment [46] . This case is important as the three -fold test was treated as of general 
applica tion in the planning context [50] . Along wit h other jurisprudence, it indicated a move away 
from  real property analogies. Lacking a preferable alternative, and as the same definition of “building” 
as was in issue in Skerritts was adopted in the Listed Building s Act, it is difficult to see any rea son in 
principle why the same test should not apply [52 ]. The application of this test to the i tems is 
something to be considered in the context of the remittal of the appeal to the First Respondent [58] .

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. It holds that  the power under article 4 of the  1972 
Order should be exercised by the Secretary of State personally, and , therefore,  that the making of the 
ICO in respect of the appellant was invalid , and that his consequent detention and convictions were 
unlawful. Lord Kerr gives the judgment  with which the other members of the court agree.  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
The question for the court was w hether the making of an ICO under article 4 of the 1972 Order  required 
personal consideration by the Secretary of State of the case of the person subject to the order or whether the Carltona  principle operated to permit the making of such an Order by a Minister of State  [8]. The 
“Carltona principle”  relates to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Carltona Ltd v Comrs of Works  [1943] 
2 All ER 560, which accepted as a principle of law  that the duties imposed upon ministers and the powers 
given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of  the ministers by responsible officials of 
the department  [9]. 
Lord Kerr consider ed the case law relied upon by the Court of Appeal to determine whether Parliament 
in the present case had intended to disapply the Carltona  principle  in the present case  at [10-27]. He 
disagreed with the Court of Appeal’s understanding of the judgment of Brightman J in In re Golden 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 Chemicals Products Ltd  [1976] Ch 300, finding that Brightman J held that the seriousness of the subject 
matter was not a consideration which was relevant at all in deciding whether the power should be 
exercised by the Minister  or by an officer in his departme nt. He considered that the Court of Appeal in 
this case was right to hold that the seriousness of the consequences is a consideration to be taken into 
account and, to the extent he suggested otherwise, Brightman J was wrong [ 13-14]. 
Next, Lord Kerr considered Oladehinde v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [1991] 1 AC 254.  There, 
the Court concluded that the statutory wording relating to the power under challenge was not, unlike 
complementary provisions in the relevant A ct, expressly limited  by way of words such as “not [to be 
exercised] by a person acting under his authority” . The absence of such express limitation of the power 
in question was a clear  indication that Carltona  there was not disapplied  in that case  [15-16]. Oladehinde  
did not consider whether the seriousness of the consequences was a relevant consideration [ 17]. 
Lord Kerr then considered Doody v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [1992] 3 WLR 956.  There, 
Carltona  was held not to have been disapplied because (1) it was established in evidence that a 
considerable burden would fall on the Secretary of State if he was to exercise the power personally and 
(2) there was no express or implied requirement in the Act in qu estion that the Secretary of State exercise 
the power personally  [18-19]. Neither consideration obtained on the facts  of this case ; Doody  was 
therefore distinguishable  [19-20]. However, Lord Kerr observed that in Doody  there had been implicit 
acknowledgeme nt that the seriousness of the consequences is a consideration to be taken into account 
[21].  
Lord Kerr did not consider  that R v Harper  [1990] NI 28 assist ed in  the resolution of the present appeal  
[23]. He then analysed  McCafferty’s Application  [2009] NICA 59, where it was suggested that there is a 
presumption in law that Parliament intends Carltona  to apply generally. Lord Kerr did not consider it 
necessary to determine whether such presumption indeed exists, given that he considered the statut ory 
language on the facts  unmistakably clear. However, he expressed an obiter  view that there is no such 
presumption at law, and that cases should instead proceed on a textual analysis of the framework of the 
legislation in question, the language of pertinent provisions in the legislation and the “importance of the subject matter,” rather than the application of a presumption [ 25-26]. 
Lord Kerr then turned to the relevant legislation. He observed that paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 4 have 
two noteworthy feat ures. First , there is the distinct segregation of roles. In paragraph 1 the making of 
the Order is provided for; in paragraph 2, the quite separate function of signing the ICO is set out. He concluded that, i f it had been intended that the Carltona  princip le should apply, there is no obvious reason 
that these roles should be given discrete treatment  [31]. The se cond  noteworthy feature of article 4(2) , 
when  read with 4(1), is that the ICO to be signed is that of the Secretary of State. The use of the words, 
“of the Secretary of State” indicates  that the ICO is one which is personal to him or her, not a generic 
order which could be made by any one of the persons named in paragraph 2  [32]. 
Lord Kerr thus reached  the following overall conclusions. First, even if a presumption exists that 
Parliament intends Carltona  to apply, it is clearly displaced  on the facts  by the proper interpretation of 
article 4(1) and 4(2) read together  [37]. Second, the consideration that  the power invested in the Secretary 
of State by article 4(1)  – a power to detain without trial and potentially for a limitless period  – was a 
momentous one  provides insight into Parliament’s intention and that the intention was that such a crucial 
decisio n should be made by the Secretary of State  personally  [38]. Third, there was no evidence that this 
would place an impossible burden on the Secretary of State [ 39].  
In conclusion, Parliament’s intention was that the power under article 4(1) of the 1972 Ord er should be 
exercised by the Secretary of State personally. The making of the ICO in respect of the appellant was 
invalid. It follows that he was not detained lawfully and  was wrongfully convicted of the offences of 
attempting to escape from lawful custod y. His convictions for those offences must be quashed  [40-41].

 The Supreme  Court unanimously dismisses the appeal . Lord Kitchin gives the sole judgment, with which

 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The starting point is  to construe the terms of the leases in context  [25]. There are certain aspects of the 
background which are highly relevant.  First,  each lease is a long -term contract and was acquired for a 
substantial premium  [27]. Secondly  and importantly , the parties would have appreciated that over the 
lifetime of the lea se it would inevitably be necessary for works to be carried out to each flat  [28]. Thirdly, 
the parties would have understood that routine improvements and modifications would be unlikely to 
impinge on the other lessees , or affect adversely the wider struc ture or fabric of the building , and that it 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 would be entirely sensible for the landlord to be in a position to permit such works  from time to time 
[29]. Fourthly, the parties must have appreciated the desirability of the landlord retaining not just the 
reversionary interest in the flats but also the rights in possession of the common parts of the building . 
Similarly, the parties must have appreciated the important and active role the landlord would play in 
managing the building and fulfilling its obligation s under each lease [30] . 
 
Clauses 2.6 and 2.7 are directed at different kinds of activity.  Clause 2.6 is concerned with routine 
improvements and alterations by a lessee to his or her flat, these being activities that all lessees would 
expect to be able to carry out, subject to the approval of the landlord.  By contrast, clause 2.7 is directed 
at activities in the nature of waste, spoil or destruction which go beyond routine alterations and 
improvements and are intrinsically such that they may be damaging to or destructive of the building.  
This concept of waste, spoil or destruction should also be treated as qualifying the covenants not to cut, 
maim or injure referred to in the rest of the clause.  In the context of this clause these words do not 
extend to c utting which is not itself destructive and is no more than incidental to works of normal 
alteration or improvement, such as are contemplated under clause 2.6.  This interpretation is supported 
by F W Woolworth and Co Ltd v Lambert  [1937] 1 Ch 37 [32]. It mu st also be remembered that the landlord 
is subject to other restrictions on its ability to license alterations to a lessee’s flat . First, each lessee enjoys 
the benefit of a covenant for quiet enjoyment  [33]. Secondly, the landlord must not derogate from i ts 
grant  [34]. Thirdly, each of the lessees is entitled to be protected against nuisance  [35]. Finally, the 
landlord has covenanted with the lessee in the terms of clause 3 of the lease , which includes , for example, 
a covenant to maintain the structure of the building  [36]. 
 The critical question  is whether the landlord can license structural work which falls within the scope of 
clause 2.7 and which would otherwise be a breach of that clause.  Clause 3.19 does not say expressly that 
the landlord  cannot give a lessee permission to carry out such work , so it must be considered whether 
this is nevertheless implicit in clause 3.19 [43]. It is well established that a party who undertakes a 
contingent or conditional obligation may, depending upon the c ircumstances, be under a further 
obligation not to prevent the contingency from occurring or from putting it out of his power to discharge 
the obligation if and when the contingency arises  [44]. The principle is well illustrated by cases involving 
breaches  of contracts to marry , and implied terms can arise from it [45- 50]. 
 There is an implied term in Dr Duval’s lease: a promise by the landlord not to put it out of its power to 
enforce clause 2.7 in the leases of other lessees by licensing what would otherw ise be a breach of it  [52]. 
That necessarily follows from a consideration of  the purpose of the covenants in clauses 2 and 3.19 and 
the content of the obligations in clause 3.19 . Clause 2.7 is an absolute covenant and, under clause 3.19, 
the complainant lessee is entitled, on provision of security, to require the landlord to enforce it as an absolute covenant.  It would not give practical content to the obligation if the landlord had the right to 
vary or modify the absolute covenant or to authorise what would otherwise be a breach of it [ 53-55]. 
Further, i t would be uncommercial and incoherent to say  that clause 3.19 can be deprived of practical 
effect if the landlord manages to give a lessee consent to carry out work in breach of clause 2.7 before another lessee makes an enforcement request and provides the necessary security . The parties cannot 
have intended that a valuable right in the objecting lessee’s lease could be defeated depending upo n who 
manages to act first, the landlord or that lessee  [57]. 
 Clause 2.7 is directed at works which go beyond routine alterations and improvements and are 
intrinsically such that they may be damaging to or destructive of the building.  It is entirely appropriate 
that works of the  kind Mrs Winfield wished to carry out should require the consent of the other lessees, 
including Dr Duval [59].

In D v United Kingdom  (1997) 24 EHRR 423 , the ECtHR held tha t to remove a man who was on his deathb ed to 
a state whe re no care was  available for him would vio late article 3 ; and it r eferred to the exceptional 
circumstances and compelling humanitarian considerations in his case  [14]. In the N case, the House of Lords  
considered the ECtH R’s decision in this case and other s like it concerning article  3. It held that  the test  in such 
cases  was whether the applicant ’s illness had reached such a  critical  stage that it would be inhuman to deprive 
him of the care he was receiving  and to send hi m to an early death  in the receivin g state , unless ther e was  care 
available there  to enable him to meet it with dignity  [15-17]. 
 
In N v United Kingdom  (2008) 47 EHRR 39 , the ECtHR held that, although there  might be “ other very 
exceptional cases in which the hu manitarian  considerations are equally compell ing” to those in  the D case, a 
high threshold for violation of article 3 should be maintained  [18]. In Paposhvili , the ECtHR  reconsidered  what 
those  “other very exce ptional cases ” were. It held  (at para 18 3) that they should now be taken  to includ e cases in 
which there were  substantial grounds for believing that the applicant , while  not at imminent risk of dying , would 
face a real risk  in the receiving co untry  of being exposed either to a serious, rapi d and  irreversible decline in 
health resu lting in  intense suffering , or to “ a significant reduction in life expectancy ” [22]. According to the  
Court of Appeal in the present case , the test for violation of article 3  following Paposh vili is no  longer  whether 
death is imminent  in the re moving  state, but whether intense suffering or death i s imminent  in the receiving 
state because  treatment is unavail able there  [29]. The Court of Appeal  was, however,  mistaken  in taking  the 
ECtHR ’s phras e, “a significant reduction in  life expectancy” , to mean “the imm inence o f death ” [30]. But what 
does the phrase  mean ? “Significant ” here mean s “substantial ”: only a substantial  reduction in life expectancy 
would reach  the level of severity required by article 3 . In addition, a reduct ion in life expectancy to d eath in t he 
near future is more likely to be sign ificant than any other reduction [31]. 
 
In Paposh vili, the ECtHR also set out requirements  (at paras  186 to 191) for the procedure to be followed in 
relation to  applications under article 3 to resist return by refere nce t o ill-health  [23, 32]. One requirement is for  
the applicant to adduce evidence “ capable of demons trating th at there  are substantial grounds for believing ” 
that, if removed, he or she  would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment cont rary to ar ticle 3 . 
That is a demanding t hreshold for the applica nt. His or her  evidence must be capable of demonstrating  
“substantial ” grounds for believing that it is a “ very exceptional case ” because of a “ real” risk o f subjection to 
“inhuman”  treatment.  He or she must  put forward  a case which, if not challenged or countered, woul d establish 
a violatio n of the article  [32]. If the applicant presents evidence to that standard, the returning state can seek to 
challen ge or count er it. Paposhvili  states that, in doing so,  the returning state must  “dispel any doubts ra ised” by 
the evidence ; but “any doubts ” here shoul d be read to mean any  serious doub ts [33]. 
 The court  should only refuse to follow a decision of the ECtH R in highly  unusual circumstances , and t here is no 
question of the court ’s refusing to follow  Paposhvili . In the light of that judgment , the court shou ld now depart 
from  the decision  of the House of Lords  in the N case [34]. 
 
The appellant first raise d his article 3  claim in the Court of Appeal  and, having accept ed that it could not 
succeed at that level , he did not  present  evidence to support it. It was inap propriate for the  Court  of Appeal to 
extract  medical reports from the evidence submitted in sup port of his a rticle 8 claim , which did not address  the 
Paposhvili  requirements  [36]. The court should not no w determine  wheth er th e reports  cross the  threshold  
required of an applicant under article 3 following Paposhvili . The proper course is to allow the  appeal and to 
remit the  article 3 claim  to be  heard on up-to-date evidence  [37].

The Supreme Court unanimously decides that the legal position under the Directive is not clear . It is 
common ground that at this stage in the process of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, in a case involving 
an issue of EU law which is unclear, the Supreme C ourt is obliged to refer that issue to the CJEU to 
obtain its advice on the point. Therefore, the Supreme Court makes an order for a reference and sets

 out the questions for the CJEU.  Lord Briggs and Lord Sales  give the judgment, with which  all other 
membe rs of the Court agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 Zipvit appealed on two issues : first, the “due or paid” issue, and second , the invoice issue. The Court 
has decided that neither issue can be regarded as acte clair  (so obvious as to leave no scope for any  
reasonable doubt ) and that a reference should be made to the CJEU . 
 The “due or paid” issue  arises out of article 168(a) of the Directive, which pro vides that a trader who is 
a taxable person has an entitlement to deduct from VAT which he is liable to pay “the VAT due or paid…in respect of supplies to him of goods or services, carried out or to be carried out by another taxable person” . Zipvit contend s that the commercial price it p aid Royal Mail for the supplies of postal 
services must be treated as having contained an element of VAT , even though the invoice purported to 
say that the services were exempt from VAT. Alternatively, even if th is embedded element of VAT is 
not to be regarded as having been “paid”, it should be regarded as being “due”  [26]-[27]. HMRC 
contend that there is nothing in the Directive which requires or justifies retrospective re -writing of the 
commercial arrangements be tween Royal Mail and Zipvit. Royal Mail did not issue further invoices to 
demand payment of VAT , cannot be compelled to issue such further invoices, and has not accounted 
to HMRC for any VAT in respect of the services . HMRC could not take action to compel Royal Mail to 
account for any VAT in respect of the supply of services . As the courts below found, if Zipvit were to 
succeed it would gain an unmerited financial windfall at the expense of the taxpayer  [31]-[32]. 
 
On the invoice  issue, Zipvit  submits that CJEU case law  indicates that there is an important difference 
between the substantive requirements to be satisfied for a claim for input tax  and the formal 
requirements that apply in relation to such a claim.  The approach is strict for the su bstantive 
requirements, but departure from the formal requirements is permissible if alternative satisfactory evidence of the VAT which was paid or is due can be produced . Zipvit contends that it has produced 
alternative satisfactory evidence of the VAT paid, in the form of payment of the embedded VAT  [36]-
[38]. Against this, HMRC submit that the regime in the Directive requires particular importance  to be 
attached to the requirement of the production of an invoice showing that VAT is due and in w hat 
amount.  A valid claim for the deduction of input tax cannot be made in the absence of a compliant VAT 
invoice [39]-[40]. 
 
The Supreme Court refers four q uestions to the CJEU. The first asks whether, in circumstances like 
those  of Zipvit , the effect of the Directive is that the price actually paid by the trader is to be regarded 
as the combination of a net chargeable amount plus VAT thereon, thus allowing the trader to claim to 
deduct input tax under article 168(a) of the Directive in the amount of  VAT which was in fact so “paid”  
by it in respect of that supply  [42(1)] . The second as ks whether, in those same circumstances, the trader 
can claim to deduct input tax under article 168(a) as VAT which was “due” in respect of that supply 
[42(2)] . The third asks whether, where a tax authority, the supplier , and the trader misinterpret Europe an 
VAT legislation and treat a taxable supply as exempt, resulting in a non- compliant VAT invoice  which 
stated that no VAT was due , the trader is entitled to claim to deduct input tax under article 168(a)  [42(3)] . 
Finally, in answering the prior  three ques tions, the Court asks whether it is relevant to investigate whether 
the supplier (Royal Mail) would have a defence to any attempt by the tax authority to issue an assessment requiring it to account for a sum representing VAT in respect of the supply, and w hether it is relevant 
that the trader (Zipvit) knew at the same time  as the tax authority and the supplier that the supply was 
not in fact exempt , and could have offered to pay the VAT due, but omitted to do so [42(4)] .

The Supreme Court unanimously allows  Barclays ’ appeal , and holds that it is not vicariously liable for Dr 
Bates’  alleged wrongdo ing. Lady Hale gives the judgment, with whi ch all members of the Court agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
Before one person can be made vicariously liable for the torts of another , two elements m ust be s hown. 
First, there must be a relationship between the two persons wh ich makes it proper fo r the law to ma ke one 
pay for the fault of the other. Second,  there must be a sufficient connection between that relationship and 
the wrongdoing  of the person who committed the tort. This case concerns the first element [1].  
 
Historically, and leavin g aside rela tionships  such as a gency and partnership, the relationships that could give 
rise to vicarious liability were limited to that between an  employee and a n emplo yer [1]. Accordingly, 
Barclays ’ case is that, since Dr Bates was an independent contract or and not  a Barclay s emplo yee, it cannot  The Supreme Cou rt of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 be held liable for his wro ngdoing . As Lord Bridge of Harwich said in D & F Estates Ltd v Church Comrs  
[1989] AC 177  at 208, “It is trite law that the employer of an independent contractor is , in general , not 
liable for th e negligence or other torts committed by the contractor in the course of the execution of the  
work ” [7].  
 
The claimants, o n the other hand, arg ue that the law has been broadened by the Supreme Court decisions 
in Various Claimants v Catholic Child  Welfare Society [2012 ] UKSC 56 (generally known as Christian Brothers) , 
Cox v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10 and Armes v Nottinghamshire County Council  [2017] UKSC 60. They 
say that these decisions  have establish ed a more nuanced approach , in which a range of factors are 
considered to determine whether or not  it is “fair, just and reasonable”  to imp ose vic arious li ability in the 
circumstances of the case  [8].  
 Lady Hale examines the se three decisions in detail at [10 -23], together with their precur sor, the Cou rt of 
Appeal  decision in E v E nglish Province of Ou r Lady of Charity [2012] EWCA Civ 93 8. The  cases make it clear 
that a person can be held vicarious ly liable for the acts of s omeone who is not  their emplo yee, provided the 
relationship  between them is sufficient ly akin or analogous to employment. However, they do not erode  
the classic distinction between employment (and relationships that are akin or analogous to employment) 
on the one hand, and the rela tionship with an independent contracto r on the other hand  [24]. Two cases 
decided by common law courts since Christian Brothers have reached the same conclusion: namely , the Court 
of Appeal ’s decision in Kaf agi v JBW Group Ltd [2018] EW CA Civ 1157 and  the Sin gapor e Court of 
Appeal ’s decision in  Ng Huat Seng v Mohamma d [2017] SGCA 58 [ 25-26].  
 
In light of this , the question is, a s it has always  been, whether the person who committed the tort is 
carrying on business on his own account, or wh ether he is in a relationship akin to employment with the 
defendant. In  doubtfu l cases, the five fac tors or “incidents ” identified by Lord Phillips in  Christian Brothers 
(reproduced at [15 ]) may help to identify a relationsh ip which is sufficiently analogous to employment to 
make it fair, just and re asonable to impose vicario us liability. But the key will usually lie in understanding 
the details of the relationship. Where it is clear that the person who committed the tort is carryin g on his 
own independent business, it is not necessary to consider the five incident s [27]. 
 
On the facts, Dr Bates was not a t any time an employee or an ything close to a n employ ee of Barcla ys. 
Rather, he  was in business on his own account as a medical practitioner, with a portfolio of patients and 
clients. He did work for Barclays, which  made  the ar rangements for the medical examinations and chose 
the questions to which it  wanted ans wers, but much the same would be true of window cleaners or 
auditors . Dr Bates was not paid a retainer, which mig ht have obl iged him to  accept a certain number of 
referra ls from Barclay s. He was paid a fee for each report and was free to refuse to conduct an offered 
examin ation . He no doubt carried his own medical liabi lity ins urance [ 28].  
 
Lady Hale considers  the relationship between  the first element of the test fo r vicarious li ability and the 
definition of “worker”  in section 230(3) of th e Employment R ights Act 199 6. She concludes that  asking 
whether or not a person  is a worker who is not an employee within the definition  in section 230(3)(b) may 
be helpfu l in identifying  whether or not  they are a true independent contractor, as opposed to being in a 
relationship akin to employment. However,  she declines to align the common law concept of vi carious 
liability , developed for one set of reaso ns, with the statutor y concept of “worker” , developed for quite a 
different set of reasons [ 29]. 
 
Accordin gly, the Court allows the appeal a nd holds that Barclay s is not v icariously liable for any assaults 
that Dr Bates is prov ed to have perp etrated in the course of the medica l examinations he carried out for 
Barclay s [30].

The Supreme Court  unanimously allows the appeal .  Lord Reed gives the only judgment, with which 
Lady Hale, Lord Kerr, Lord Hodge and Lord Lloyd -Jones agree.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The primary issue before the Court is whether the appellant is vicariously liable for Skelton’s conduct.  
The starting p oint is Lord Toulson’s judgment in Mohamud , which was not intended to change the law 
of vicarious liability but rather to follow existing precedents [16 -21]. One such  authority was the House 
of Lords ’ decision  in Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam  [2003] 2 AC 366 (“Dubai Aluminium ”), where 
Lord Nicholls explained the existing “close connection” test  of whether the wrongful conduct was so 
closely connected with acts the employee was authorised to do that for the purposes of the liability of 
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 the empl oyer to third parties, it may fairly and properly be regarded as done by the employee while acting 
in the ordinary course of his  employment . The test had to be  applied having regard to the circumstances 
of the case and previous court decisions , following Dubai Aluminium [22- 23].  
 
Having explained the “close connection” test, Lord Toulson summarised the law in “the simplest terms” .  
The f irst question was what functions or  “field of activities” the employer had entrusted to the employee .  
Next, “the court m ust decide whether there was sufficient connection between the position in which he 
was employed and his wrongful conduct to make it right for the employer to be held liable under the principle of social justice which goes back to Holt CJ”. This had been m ore fully explained in Dubai 
Aluminium  by Lord Nicholls as set out above [25] .  Lord Toulson was not suggesting any departure from 
Lord Nicholls ’ approach [26]. Further, r ead in context, Lord Toulson’s  comments that on the facts of 
Mohamud there was an “unbroken sequence of events” and a “seamless episode” referred to the  capacity 
in which the employee had been purporting to act  when the wrongful conduct took place, namely “about 
his employer’s business” [28]. Lord Toulson’s comment , in rela tion to the facts of Mohamud,  that 
“motive is irrelevant” should not be  taken out of context: whether the employee was acting on his 
employer’s business or for personal reasons  was important , but, on the facts of Mohamud,  the reason 
why he had committed the tort  could not make a material difference to the outcome  [29-30].  
 
The Court concludes  that the judge and the Court of Appeal misunderstood the principles governing 
vicarious liability in a number of  respects.  First, the online disclosure of the data was not part of Skelton’s 
“field of activities ”, as it was not an act which he was authorised to do . Secondly, the satisfaction of the 
factors referred to by Lord Phillips in Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society  [2012] UKSC 56 
was not to the point: those factors were relevant to whethe r, where the wrongdoer was not an employee,  
the relationship between wrongdoer and defendant was sufficiently akin to employment for vicarious 
liability to subsist . They were not concerned with whether  employees ’ wrongdoing was so closely 
connected with their  employment that vicarious liability ought to be imposed. Thirdly, a temporal or 
causal connection alone does not satisfy the close connection test . Finally, it was highly material whether 
Skelton w as acting on his employer’s bus iness o r for purely personal reasons [31].   
 Considering the question afresh, no vicarious liability arises in the present case . Skelton  was authorised 
to transmit the payroll data to the auditors. His wrongful disclosure of the data was not so closely connected with that task that it c an fairly and properly be regarded as made by Skelton while acting in 
the ordinary course of his employme nt. On long -established principles, the fact that his employment 
gave him the opportunity to commit the wrongful act i s not sufficient to warrant the imposition of 
vicarious liability. An employer  is not normally vicariously liable where the employee was n ot engaged 
in furthering his employer’s business, but rather was pursuing a personal vendetta. The “close 
connection”  test elucidated by Lord Nicholls in Dubai Aluminium , in light of the cases that have applied 
it and on the particular facts of the present  appeal, is not satisfied  [32-47].  
 The second major issue before  the Court is whether the DPA excludes imposition of vicarious liability 
for either statutory or common law wrongs . It is not strictly necessary to consider this in light of the 
above conclusion, but as full argument was heard , it is desirable that the C ourt express es a view [48] . 
Ultimately the C ourt finds the appellant’s argument that liability is excluded  unpersuasive . Impos ing 
statutory liability on a data controller like  Skelton is not inconsistent with the co- existence of vicarious 
liability at common law, whether for breach of the DPA or for a common law or equitable wrong , as the 
DPA says nothing about a data controller’s e mployer. It is irrelevant that a data controller’s statutory 
liability under the DPA is based on a lack of reasonable care, while vicarious liability for an employee’s conduct requires no proof of fault. The same contrast exists at common law  between, for example, an 
employee ’s liability in  negligence and an employer’s vicarious liability. It makes no difference  that an 
employee’s liability may arise under statute instead [54 -55].  The appeal is therefore allowed [56] .

The Supreme Court unanimou sly dismisses the Insurers’  appeal and allows the Bank’s appeal , declaring 
that the High Court  does not have jurisdiction o ver any of the Insurers ’ claims against the Bank. Lord 
Hodge gives the sole judgment with which the other Jus tices agree.    
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT  
 
The Supreme Court affirms the findings of Teare J and the Court of  Appe al that the Bank is not 
bound by the exclusive j urisdiction clause in the  Policy  [23]. Under EU law,  a jurisdiction agreement 
will only bind a party if there is actual consensus between the parties which is clearly and precisely 
demonstrated [24]. Althou gh not a party to the Policy , EU law recognise s that the Bank  may be taken 
to have consented to the jurisdiction clause  if, as a matter of nationa l law, it became  a “successor ” to 
the Owners  under the Policy [25]. As an equitable assignee,  the Bank did not t ake o n the Owners ’ 
obligations under the Policy . Howe ver, nor was it  entitled to a ssert its assigned rights in a way that was 
inconsistent with the terms of the Policy , including  the jurisdiction c lause [26-28]. In fact, th e Bank 
had not asserted its right s under the Policy  at all: it left the settle ment negoti ations to the Owners and 
its Letter of Authority merely facilitated th at settlement [29]. Not being a party to the Policy, it is not  
required  to submit to the jurisdiction of the English courts in an actio n brought by the Insurers  [30]. 
 The Supreme C ourt finds that  the Insurers’ claims against the Bank are “matters relating to insurance”  
within the meaning of  section 3 of the Regulation  [41]. The Supr eme Court notes that th e title of 
section 3 is drafted i n broade r language than other sections of the Regulation , which refer to individual 
contract s [35]. It is also significant that  the scheme of section 3 is concerned with the rights not only 
of parties to an insurance contra ct but also of beneficiaries and i njured parties, who will typically be 
non-parties  [36]. The recitals to the R egulation  do not operate to narrow the  scope of section 3  [37]. 
Whereas EU case law indicates  that articles derogating  from the general rule in article 4 shou ld be 
interpret ed st rictly, article 14 operate s to reinforce article 4  and s o need not be read narrowly [38]. 
Even if section 3 were to apply  only to claims based on  a breach of an individual insur ance contract, 
the insurance fraud alleged by  the Insurers would inevitably ent ail a brea ch of the Policy  [40]. 
 The Supreme Court holds that there is no “weaker party ” exception to the protection of article 14  
[43]. Article 14 protects certain  categories of person  because they are generally the “ weaker party ” in a 
comm ercial negotia tion with an insurance company , not because of their individual characteristics  
[44]. Whilst  recital (18) explains the policy behind  section 3 , it is the words of article  14 which have 
legal effect [ 45]. Article 14 re fers to  the policyh older,  the insured a nd the beneficiary without further 
qualification  and d erogations from the jurisdictional rules in matters of insurance must be interpreted 
strictly  [46, 57 ]. In any case, i t would  undermine legal certainty if the applicability of sectio n 3 we re to 
depend on a case by case a nalysis of the relative strength or weakness of contracting parties . This is 
why the Court of Justice of the Europea n Union (“CJEU ”) has treated everyone within the categories 
identified  in article 14 as protected unle ss the  Regulatio n explicitly provides otherwise  [47-49]. The 
CJEU  only ha s rega rd to recital (18)  in deciding whether to extend the protections of article 14 to 
persons who do not fall within the identified  categories , not to decide whether a particular 
policyho lder, insured o r beneficiary is to be protected [ 50-56]. Further , in deciding  whether to extend 
the protections of article 14 in this way , the C JEU seeks to uphold the general rule in article 4 [43]. 
 
As a result of these  conclusions , it is n ot necessar y for the Supreme  Court to address whether the 
Insurers’ restitution claims are matters relating  to “tort, delict or quasi -delict” under article 7(2)  [61].

The Supreme Court allows the  appeal . The majority of the Justices (Lord Reed, Lord Carnwath , Lord 
Hodge, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd- Jones) dismiss the challenge to the decision brought under the 
common law, but the Court unanimously holds that the decision failed to comply with the DPA. Lord Kerr would have allow ed the appeal on both grounds . Lady Hale’s judgment acts as a short guide to the 
other judgments.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
Ground (i) : Has the common law evolved to recognise a principle prohibiting the provision of 
MLA that will facilitate the death penalty?  
The majority answer this question “no”. The reasons for considering that the common law has not developed so far are explained by Lord Reed and Lord Carnwath.  
Lord Carnwath finds that the power of the courts to develop the common law must be exercised wit h 
caution [ 193]. The death penalty as such has never attracted the attention of the common law: the key 
legal developments have come from Parliament and the ECHR, not from the domestic courts [ 194]. 
One recent development is section 16 of the Crime (Overse as Production Orders) Act 2019. This 
section confirms: (i) that this is an area in which Parliament remains directly involved; and (ii) that, where the Act applies, there is nothing that specifically prohibits the Home Secretary from exchanging 
material in  cases whether they have sought but have not received assurances that the information they The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 exchange will not be used to facilitate the death penalty. This suggests that the common law has not 
developed as suggested by Lord Kerr [ 195].  
Lord Carnwath also f inds that powers to deport or extradite under domestic law are subject to review 
on public law grounds, but are not subject to an absolute prohibition on removal by reference to the possible consequences in the receiving state [ 198]. Finally, it is difficu lt to reconcile the DPA scheme 
with the development of an absolute common law prohibition as advanced by Lord Kerr [ 205].  
Lord Reed agrees with Lord Carnwath for the reasons given in his judgment and for additional 
reasons . He finds  that the common law is subject to judicial development, but such development  must 
build incrementally on existing principles. This is necessary to: (i) preserve legal certainty; and (ii)  
ensure compatibility with  the pre -eminent constitutional role of Parliament in making new la w [170]. 
The development of the law proposed by Lord Kerr does not seem to Lord Reed to be an incremental 
step [171 ].  
Lord Reed adds that  judicial recognition of the value of life can have an important influence on 
adjudication in this context. This is because the courts are required to take a more rigorous approach when reviewing the exercise of discretion where life may be  at stake [ 176-178]. Lord Reed refers to the 
respondent’s submissions that the Home Secretary’s decision- making complied with that higher 
standard of review [ 179]. He notes that the Home Secretary’s decision might have been open to 
challenge on the ground that it failed t o comply with the common law requirement of rationality, but 
declines to express a view on this [ 181-182].  
Lord Hodge agrees with Lord Reed and Lord Carnwath that the common law does not recognise a right to life which can be used to prevent the Home Secr etary from providing information to a foreign 
country in the context either of MLA  or the sharing of intelligence  [231-234]. 
Lord Kerr underlines the steadfast opposition by successive UK governments to the imposition of the 
death penalty in any circumstan ces, and the related long -standing policy not to provide MLA unless 
death penalty assurances are received [ 26]. He notes that the common law is not immutable but 
develops over time to reflect the changing values of society [ 102].  
Lord Kerr summarises six factors favouring recognition of the common law principle in question at [141]: (i) the Bill of Rights; (ii) British contemporary values; (iii)  European Court of Human Rights  
(‘ECHR ’) jurisprudence  (discussed at [ 107-124]) ; (iv) EU jurisprudence  (discussed at [ 125-134]) ; (v) the 
fundamental illogicality of refusing to extradite or deport individuals for trial where there is a risk of 
the imposition of the death penalty, on the one hand,  and facilitating precisely such an outcome by the 
provision of MLA without requiring assurances, on the other; and (vi) Judicial Committee of the Privy 
Council jurisprudence  (discussed at [ 135-140]) .  
Lord Kerr concludes that a common law principle should be recognised whereby it is deemed unlawful 
to facilitate the trial of any individual in a foreign country where, to do so, would put that person in 
peril of being executed  [142]. This principle should be disapplied only if MLA is absolutely necessary as 
a matter of urgency in order to save lives or p rotect the nation’s security [ 164]. 
Law must be responsive to society’s contemporary needs, standards and values, which are in a state of constant change. That is an essential part of the human condition and experience. The adjustment to the common law proposed reflects the contemporary standards and values of our society [ 144]. 
 
Ground (ii) : Is it lawful under Part 3 of the DPA to transfer personal data to law enforcement 
authorities abroad for use in capital criminal proceedings?  
The Court is unanimous in holding that the Home Secretary’s decision was unlawful under the DPA.  
The DPA requires the data controller to address his mind to the specific requirements of the Act and 
this was not done.  The DPA is discussed by Lady Hale at [ 6-15], Lord Kerr at [ 152-159] and Lord 
Carnwath at [ 207-228].  
Lady Hale outlines the basic structure of the DPA at [ 8-12]. She explains that Part 3 of the DPA makes 
provision about the processing of personal data by competent authorities for “law enforceme nt 
purposes.” Sections 73 to 76 set out the general conditions that apply to such transfers. The data 
controller cannot transfer data unless the three conditions in s. 73(1)(a) are  met [8]. Condition 1 is that The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 the transfer is necessary  for any of the law enforcement purposes  [9]. Condition 2 is that the transfer is 
(a) based on an adequacy decision of the European Commission; (b) if not based on an adequacy 
decision, is based on there being appropriate safeguards; or (c) if not based on an adequacy decision or 
appropriate safeguards, is based on special circumstances  [10]. She notes that this transfer was not 
based on an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, because there were none  [10]. Nor does the 
transfer meet the special circ umstances requirement: a transfer is based on special circumstances only 
if it is necessary  for any of the five purposes listed in s. 76(1). This condition is not met [ 12]. 
Lord Carnwath agrees  that there has been a breach of the DPA. He focuses on the pro visions 
governing transfers of personal data to a third country in ss.  72 to 78 of Part 3. S. 73 deals specifically 
with transfers of personal data to a third country and prohibits such transfers unless a number of conditions are met. As Lady Hale, he note s that Condition 2  is that the transfer must be based on an 
adequacy decision , or on there being appropriate safeguards, or on special circumstances . There was no 
adequacy decision here, hence the discussion centres upon whether there were appropriate safeguards 
or special circumstances sanctioning the transfer [ 209-213]. S. 75 defines the circumstances  in which a 
transfer is based upon there being appropriate safeguards, discussed at [ 214-219]. Lord Carnwath 
concludes that the information in question was transferred without any  safeguards  at all [ 220]. The 
lawfulness of the transfer therefore stands or falls on the “special circumstances” condition [ 221]. The 
circumstances in which a transfer is based on special circumstances are defined in s. 76, discussed at [221-224]. Lord Carnwath concludes that the Act requires a specific assessment under the section, and 
that this did not take place [ 225]. The decision was based on political expediency, rather than 
consideration of strict necessity under the statutory criteria [ 227]. It was consequently unlawful under 
the DPA.  
Lady Hale raises a further issue under s.  76(2) DPA, which concerns the special circumstances gateway. 
S. 76(2) provides  that: “subsection (1)(d) and (e) do not apply if the controller determines that 
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject override the public interest in the transfer ” [12]. 
Lady Hale finds that these fundamental rights and freedoms include the rights protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, the most fundamental of which is the right to life [ 13-14]. 
This points towards an interpretation of s.  76(2) which would not allow the transfer of personal data to 
facilitate a prosecution which could result in the death penalty [ 15].  
Lord Carnwath sees the force of Lady Hale’s comments. He concludes that, at least, failure to consider this point is a further reason f or holding that the Home Secretary’s decision cannot stand [ 228]. Lord 
Hodge also sees the force of Lady Hale’s comments, but as the point was not fully argued, he reserves his position on it [ 230].  
Lord Kerr agrees that there is a breach of the DPA, but for different reasons. He notes that it is common ground that  provision of MLA involved the “processing” of personal data falling within Part 
3 DPA. S uch processing is only lawful where it complies with the data protection principles in section 
34 DPA. Unlike the other justices, Lord Kerr held, under ground 1, that  the transfer of material to the 
US authorities without obtaining death penalty assurances was contrary to the common  law. He 
therefore concludes that  it follows that the first and second data protection principles in s. 34 – 
requiring processing that is lawful and fair – are not met [152- 153]. 
Lord Kerr goes on to discuss s.  73 DPA  [154]. He agrees that  there was no adequacy decision and no 
appropriate safeguards [ 155]. Transfer on the basis of  special circumstances can only occur following 
an assessment of what is strictly necessary. Such an assessment was not made  [158], hence the transfer 
of data breached s. 73 .

The Supreme Court  unanimously allows the appeal . Lady Hale gives the only judgment , with which Lord Kerr, 
Lady Black, Lord Lloyd -Jones and Lord Briggs  agree.  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
 
As to the preliminary issue, following a hearing in October 2019, the EHRC was permitted to intervene and  take 
over the appeal . An intervener is a party to an appeal (Rules of the Supreme Court, rule 3(1)) and an appeal can 
only be withdrawn with the consent of all parties or the permission of the Court (rule 34(1)).  The appeal therefore 
remained on foot until the Court permitte d otherwise. The Court is permitted to adopt any procedure consistent 
with the overriding objective, the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and the Rules (rule 9(7)). The overriding 
objective is to secure that the Court is accessible, fair and efficient (rule 2(2)).  Where an important question of 
law that may have been decided wrongly below is raised in an appeal, it is open to the Court to permit intervention 
and allow the intervener to take over the conduct of the appeal [ 9-10].  
 On the principal issue, the  Secretary of State  conceded that, when determining an appeal as to whether a removal 
decision would infringe  rights under the ECHR , a tribunal must determine the relevant factual issues for  itself on 
the evidence before it, albeit giving due weight to a decision -making authority’s prior determination.  It therefore 
became common ground that a tribunal is not bound by a decision of the NRM nor must it seek a public law ground for finding such a decision flawed [11].  This is because a tribunal has statutory jurisdiction to hear appeals 
from immigration decisions . The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and Immigration Rules indicate 
that those appeals are plainly intended to involve the hearing of evidence and determination of factual issues.  The 
House of Lords in Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 11; [2007] 2 AC 167  had made 
clear that this was a tribunal’s role [12-14].  
 The proper consideration and weight to be given to an authority’s previous decision will d epend on the nature of 
that decision and its relevance to the issue before the tribunal.  In the present case, the FTT and the UT were better placed to decide whether the Appell ant was a victim of trafficking than the authority.  The more difficult 
question was the relevance of that factual determination to the appeals  [15]. This depended upon the relationship 
between the obligations in ECAT and the obligations in article 4 of the  ECHR [ 17]. 
 Article 4 of ECAT defines trafficking such that a child, recruited and transported for the purpose of exploitation 
through forced labour or services, may be considered a victim of trafficking  [18]. ECAT also imposes other 
obligations on states , to prevent trafficking and to identify and protect its victims [19].  In Siliadin v France (2006) 
43 EHRR 6, the European Court of Human Rights held that states have positive obligations under article 4 of the ECHR to adopt and apply  criminal law provisions against slavery, servitude , and forced labour. In  Rantsev v Cyprus 
and Russia (2010) 51 EHRR 1, it held that trafficking within the meaning of article 4 of ECAT fell within the scope 
of article 4 of the ECHR.   The state  had a positive obligation to prevent, to investigate, to protect and to punish 
[23-26]. This was confirmed in Chowdury v Greece  (Application No 2184/15)  and in J v Austria  (Application No 
58216/13) [32 -33]. The investigative duty arises whether or not the re has been a complaint and must be capable 
of leading to the identification and punishment of the individuals responsible [25] . 
 
In the present case, the UT decided that the Appellant was indeed a victim of trafficking. Once brought to the 
attention of police, the Appellant was removed from the risk of further exploitation, while the UT held that he would not be at risk of re -traffick ing if returned to Pakistan. However, there ha d not yet been an effective 
investigation into the breach of article 4, as the police took no action after referring him to social services. Such an investigation is required and cannot take place if the Appellant is removed to Pakistan. The appeal is  therefore 
allowed  and the UT’s decision on this ground restored [34-36].

 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
 
The majority examines the 1883 Act in light of other amendments to the criminal law around the same time, 
namely the Offences Against t he Person Act 1861 (“ 1861 Act ”) and the regulatory Explosive Substances Act 
1875 (“the 1875 Act”)  [14-15]. The 1883 Act was passed by Parliament with great speed due to fears around 
Irish nationalism and a perception that the 1861 Act,  in particular , did not provide sufficiently for protection of 
the public  [16]. 
 
The current  regulatory regime is now primarily contained in the Explosives Regulation s 2014 , which  like the 
1875 Act before them , make clear that it is expected that private i ndividuals, including “hobbyists”, may 
manufacture and keep explosives for their own private use [ 18]. 
 In R v Fegan (1984) 78 Cr App R 189 , the Court of Criminal Appeal in Northern Ireland explained that section 
4(1) had been passed to address perceived deficiencies in other offences. These required proof of a specific mental element , and so were inadequate to guard against the risk of makin g or possessing explosives.  The 
appellant, Fegan, acquired a firearm and ammunition (which qualified as explosive substances for the purpose of 
the 1 883 Act) to protect himself and his family from threats against their safety and was convicted of an offenc e 
under section 4(1)  of the 1883 Act. His appeal was successful, on the basis that although he had no licence for 
the possession of the firearm and ammunition,  nonetheless he possessed the m for a lawful purpose, i.e. to 
defend himself and his family  [19-22].  
 Fegan was followed  on similar facts  in Attorney -General’s Reference (No 2 of 1983)  [1984] QB 456  [24-25]. Finally, in 
Riding , the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales  held that in the particular 
circumstanc es of that case,  curiosity did not qualify as  a lawful object  for the possession of a home -made pipe 
bomb [26].  
 
Under section 4(1), it is for a defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that he had possession or 
control of an explosive substance for a lawf ul object . In Engl ish law, a purpose is lawful unless it is made 
unlawful by statute or the common law.  A lawful object may , however,  be tainted by an ulterior, unlawful 
purpose, including by knowledge or recklessness of a risk of injury or damage ; but these would be matters to be 
explored on the evidence at trial  [27-29]. 
 
The decision in Riding was correct on its facts,  because the de fence of the accused in that case was that he acted 
out of curiosity to see if he could construct  a pipe -bomb but he did not need to use real explosives for that; and 
it was no part of his defence that he had wanted to experiment by making it explode . The decision  does not  
provide an answer in the different circumstances of  the present case  and was mis interpreted  in the courts  below . 
Experimentation and self -education are “objects” within the ordinary meaning of that term and are capable of 
being lawful objects for the purposes of section 4(1).  This view is reinforced by the background against which  
section 4(1) was enacted , including the 1875 Act, under which possession of explosive substances for private 
experimentation and use was regarded as lawful and legitimate [ 30-33], [35] . The Court of Appeal was wrong to 
conclude that  the appellant was obliged to specify more precisely than  he had  done  how the explosiv es would 
be used and that this would be lawful. Th e Court of Appeal’s reasoning was inconsistent with the Fegan  and 
Attorney -General’s Reference  cases , in which it had been held that an assertion of a general object of self -defence 
was lawful  [34] . As there is nothing unlawful about experimentation and self -education as objects in themselves, 
they are capable of being lawful objects [ 37]. There is no requirement in law that a defence statement in relation 
to a charge under section 4(1) has to give a more detailed account of the proposed use of the explosive 
substance than that provided by the appellant [39]. The appellant ought to have been permitted to present his 
defence at trial [41], [43] .  
 
Lord Lloyd -Jones and Lord Hamblen dissent from the majority’s reasoning  and would dismiss the appeal . They 
take the view, in common with the courts below, that personal experimentation and private education cannot in 
law amount to lawful objects  within the meaning of section 4(1) [51]. The word “object” refers to the reason for 
doing something , or the result you wish to achieve by doing it. As such, the Court of Appeal was c orrect to hold 
that, to make out the defence, a defendant is required to show the use to which the explosive substance is to be 
put, and to do so with sufficient particularity to demonstrate that that use is lawful [52] . Reference to private 
education and personal experimentation is not enough, as the Court of Appeal previously held in Riding  [54].   
 
The defence is only made out if it is shown that the way in which the explosives were  intended to be used is 
lawful.  It is not enough to show that it may be lawful . A defence statement in response to a charge under 
section 4(1) should elaborate upon this  and provide some details of the intended use . In the present case  the The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
 appellant envis aged that experimentation would take the form of detonations of the explosives in his  back 
garden , carrying an obvious risk of causing injury, damage to property, and a  public nuisance. It was necessary 
to particularise how this  would be carried out so as to avoid any such risk or would otherwise be lawful.  Vague 
and general statements referring to personal experimentation or private education were insufficient and did not 
show how that was to be carried out lawfully  [55].   
 
Finally, Fegan  and Attorney -General’s Reference are distinguishable,  insofar as the object of use in lawful self -defence 
was plausibly raised in each. In contrast, in the present case no lawful use is identified, and the claimed objects 
neither give sufficient indication of the use to which the explosives are to be put, nor do they permit assessment 
of the lawfulness of any such use  [56] .

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. It holds that the appellant was unlawfully detained and 
is entitled to pursue a claim for damages for false imprisonment. Lord Kerr, with whom Lord Wilson, Lady 
Black and Lord Kitchin agree, gives the lead judgment. Lord Carnwath gives a concurring judgment.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  
 Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD  T: 020 7960 1886/1887  F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.uk  
  
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
Lord Kerr, with whom Lord Wilson, Lady Black and Lord Kitchin agree  
First, the Court notes that Lord Dyson in R  (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 
12 made it clear that there is no difference between a detention that is unlawful because there was no 
statutory power to detain and a detention that is unlawful because the decision to detain was made in 
breach of a rule of public law. Here, as in Lumba , there was no statutory power to detain. The 2004 Order 
upon which the decision to deport was based was ruled unlawful in EN (Serbia) . As detention was for the 
express purpose of facilitating deportation, without a lawful deportation order the occasion for detention 
simply does not arise [17] . 
Second, detention is entirely dependent on the decision to deport. DN’s  detention was uniquely linked to 
the deportation order. Without a lawful decision to deport, the question of detention cannot arise, much 
less be legal [18, 20 ]. The lawfulness of detention is always referable back to the legality of the decision to 
deport, and this is not an instance of a series of successive steps, each having an independent existence. For 
this reason, the Court does not accept the argument that the independent judicial decision made in 
statutory appeals (per section 82 of the 2002 Act) is a step “removing the legal error” in question. The 
rubric, “chain of causation” is inapposite in this context [19]. 
The Court considers that Draga was wrongly decided, for the reasons given by Lord Carnwath. Further, the 
Court considers that, if and insomuch as Ullah  suggests that paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 of the 1971 Act 
provides stand- alone authority for lawful detention, no matter what has gone before and irrespective of the 
fact that the decision to deport lacks legal basis, that decision too was wrong.  
Lord Carnwath  
Lord Carnwath agrees with Lord Kerr’s judgment, but adds his thoughts, particularly on the issue of res 
judicata / issue estoppel, which was not discussed in argument but which to his mind could provide a 
complete answer in similar cases in the future [1].  
Lord Carnwath agrees that the decision to detain in this case was directly dependent on the deportation 
decision and that, as such, DN’s claim for damages comes clearly within the Lumba principle, unless 
excluded by some specific rule of law. No such rule emerges from the reasons of the Court of Appeal in 
Draga or from submissions for the Secretary of State [9 -10]. 
Lord Carnwath considers Draga was wrongly decided for two reasons. First, Pill LJ’s suggested grounds for 
distinguishing R v Governor of Brockhill  Prison, Ex p Evans (No 2) [2002] 2 AC 19 are unpersuasive : it could 
not be said that the Secretary of State was acting within the four corners of a court order relating to the 
applicant’s detention. Rather, the decision of the tribunal related only to deportation [11-12] . Second, Pill 
LJ’s reliance on the “second actor theory” was misplaced: where the Secretary of State is directly 
responsible for making the order later found to be unlawful, it would be odd if it could rely on it to support the validity of later actions based on it [12] . 
Finally, Lord Carnwath considers that issue estoppel, if argued, could have provided the answer to this appeal. DN’s private law claim for damages depended on the lawfulness of the deportation decision at the 
time it was made. That issue was conclusive ly determined by the decision of the tribunal in August 2007 
and the decision of the High Court rejecting the application for review. DN had the opportunity to 
challenge the legality of the original deportation decision by reference to the invalidity of the 2004 Order, 
but did not do so. Hence, he would be estopped from challenging it at a later date [30] . However, since the 
Secretary of State did  not rely on res judicata, it would be unfair to DN for the court to introduce it at this 
stage [37] .

 The Supreme Court unanimously holds that the present proceedings do not constitute “a criminal 
cause or matter”, with the result that th e Court does not have jurisdiction to consider the appeals . Lord 
Sales gives the judgment , with which all the members of the Court agree.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
 
Section 41 of the 1978 Act provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court “from any decision of the 
High Court in a criminal cause or matter” [21] . The phrase “a criminal cause or matter” has been used 
in two different statutory contexts: first in provisions governing rights of appeal; and second in section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013  (“the JSA 2013”)  in relation to a specia l closed procedure for 
secret intelligence material in court proceedings.  As accepted by the Supreme Court in R (Belhaj) v 
Director of Public Prosecutions  (No 1) [2018] UKSC 33; [2019] AC 593, the statutory context of section 6 
of the JSA 2013 is different from that of section 41(1)  of the 1978 Act  [24] . 
 
The Supreme Court  review s the history of the phrase from its first use in section 47 of the Supreme 
Court of Judicature Act 1873 to th e 1978 Act , which replicated in Northern Ireland the appeal  system 
of England and Wales  [25] -[56]. Two basic features of the regime of appeal rights are important. First, 
the appeal rights in relation to a High Court decision in a criminal cause or matter are directed primarily to maintaining the coherence of the legal system rather than rectifying specific errors. An 
appeal to the Supreme Court is only possible if a point of law of general public importance is certified 
[66]. Second, in contrast, in all other cases appeal rights from the High Court to the Court of  Appeal 
are directed to ensuring that errors at first instance in individual cases can be rectified. No showing of 
public importance is required [67] . 
 The leading case on the meaning of the phrase  “a criminal cause or matter”  is that of the House of 
Lords in Amand v Home Secretary [1943] AC 147. The approach set out in that decision requires 
consideration of  the proceedings which underlie those in the High Court . A criminal cause or matter 
will be : (a) one that put s the applic ant in jeopardy of criminal punishment ; and (b) where  that 
punishment  is “the direct outcome” of the proceeding [ 66], [77]. 
 The issue raised in the present case does not relate to the commencement or conduct of any 
underlying criminal process involving Mr Stone. He is not subject to any outstanding undetermined 
criminal charge on which he will be tried and may be subjected to s entence. The present proceedings 
are concerned with whether his past criminal sentence has been correctly understood and implemented.  The High Court decision was therefore not in “a criminal cause or matter” and the 
relevant right of appeal is to the Court  of Appeal, not the Supreme Court [78] . As a result , and 
because the Supreme Court is likely to be assisted by consideration by the Northern Ireland Court of 
Appeal on the operation of the 1998  Act, should the case return for consideration,  the Supreme Court 
does not think it appropriate to say anything about the merits of the appeals [96].

The Supreme Court unanimously allow s the Claimants’  cross -appeal and lift s the stay. In light of this, it is no 
longer necessary to consider Romania’s  appeal in relation to security, so th at order is discharged . Lord Lloyd -
Jones and Lord Sales  give the judgment, with which  all members of the Court a gree. 
 
REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
 
The Court consider s the Claimants’ cross -appeal first [40] . The Claimants appeal the stay on five grounds: (1) 
the effect of the GCEU’s judgment is that the duty of sincere co -operation no longer requires the English 
courts  to stay enforcement; (2) there is no power to order a stay under the ICSID Convention and the 1966 Act; 
(3) the stay is incompati ble with the ICSID Convention; (4) the European Communities Act 1972 does not 
require the United Kingdom to breach pre -accessi on obligations under the ICSID Convention; and (5) Article 
351 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (“TFEU”) applies , with t he result that the obligations of the 
United Kingdom under the pre -accession ICSID Convention are not subject to the overriding effect of EU law  
[38]-[39]. 
 
First, the Claimants submit that the GCEU decision annulling  the Commission Decision changes the 
circumstances , meaning  there is no EU law duty on the English courts to stay enforcement [43]. Romania, and 
the Commission inter vening, submit that the GCEU judgment annuls only the Commission Decision and not 
the injunction or initiating decision s [44]. The Court consider s that the GCEU judgment leaves in existence an 
extant Commission investigation into State aid. Without a final  Commission decision closing the formal 
investigation procedure, the effects of the initiating decision subsist, imposing a duty of sincere co -operation on 
the English courts  [51]. 
 
Second, in relation to the Claimants’ second and third grounds, the Court examines  the ICSID Convention and 
the 1966 Act [60] -[63]. The Court emphasises that the scheme of the ICSID Convention does no t permit a 
domestic court before which recognition is sought to r e-examine an award on its merits, once its authenticity is 
establ ished [68]. In light of the wording of articles 54(1) and the preparatory materials, it is arguable that there is 
scope for certain exceptional defences against enforcement if national law recognises them in respect of final 
domestic judgments [78]. Though  the proper i nterpretation of article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention is 
something which could only be authoritatively resolved by the International Court of Justice , it does not affect 
the outcome of the present case  [83]. The Court agrees with the majority  in the Court  of Appeal that English 
courts have the power to stay execution of an ICSID award in the limited circumstances they describe, but in 
the present circumstances the granting of a stay  exceeds the proper limits of that power  and is not consistent  
with the ICS ID Convention [84]. 
 
Finally , the Claimants’ fourth and fifth grounds collapse into one another and thus fall  to be considered together 
[89]. Article 351 TFEU is intended to establish that the application of the EU treaties does not affect the  duty 
of a member state to respect the rights of non- member states under a prior agreement and to per form its 
obligations thereunder [97]. In the Court’s view, the specific duties in articles 54 and 69 of the ICSID 
Convention are owed to all other Contracting States , including non -member states [ 107]-[108] . The duty of 
sincere co -operation does not require courts in this jurisdiction to decline to decide the issue pending its 
resolution by the EU courts ; EU case law makes it clear that questions regarding p rior treati es under article 351 
are not reserved to the EU courts.  The article 351 issue here  – the extent of the United Kingdom’s obligations 
under the ICSID Convention – is not the same issue that is before the EU courts [112] -[113] . The possibility 
that the EU cou rts may consider the issue at some future stage is contingent and remote . In such circumstances 
the duty of sincere co -operation does not require the imposition of a stay of enforcement of the Award [117] .

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
 
Imprisonment  
 The essence of imprisonment is being made to stay in a particular place by another person. The 
methods which might be used to keep a person there are many and various. They include physical barriers, guards or threats of force or of legal process [24] . 
 In thi s case there is no doubt that the Secretary of State  defined the place where the claimant was to 
stay between the hours of 11.00 pm and 7.00 am. There was no suggestion that he could go somewhere else during those hours without the Secretary of State’s per mission  [25]. Although the 
claimant broke his curfew from time to time, this made no difference to his situation while he was obeying it. Like a prisoner who goes absent from an open prison, or a tunneller who successfully 
escapes from a prison camp, the c laimant was not imprisoned while he was away , but he was 
imprisoned as long as he stayed at home [26]. 
 
Although it was physically possible for the claimant to leave, his compliance was enforced and not 
voluntary. He was wearing an electronic tag which meant that leaving his address would be detected. 
The monitoring company would then telephone him to find out where he was. He was warned in the clearest possible terms that breaking the curfew could lead to a £5 ,000 fine or imprisonment for up to 
six months or both. He was well aware that it could also lead to his being detained again under the 1971 Act. All of this was backed up by the full authority of the State, which was claiming to have the 
power to do this  [27] . This is a case of “ classic detention or confinement ” [28] . 
 Deprivation of liberty  
 The ECHR distinguishes between deprivation and mere restriction of physical liberty. Whether there 
has been a deprivation of liberty depends on a number of factors including the type, duration and effects of the confinement [29] -[30]. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v JJ [2007] UKHL 45, 
Lord Brown expressed the view that an eight -hour curfew would not amount to a deprivation of 
liberty for these purposes [32]. Consequently, the S ecretary of State argued the curfew in this case 
would not amount to a deprivation of liberty, and suggested the time had come to align the domestic 
law of false imprisonment with the concept of deprivation of liberty under the ECHR.  
 The Supreme Court unanimously declines to do so. Although the common law may develop to meet 
the changing needs of society , this proposal would not develop the law but make it take a retrograde 
step. It would restrict the classic understanding of imprisonm ent at common law to the very different 
and much more nuanced concept of deprivation of liberty under the ECHR . This approach derives 
from the need to distinguish under the ECHR between the deprivation and the restriction of physical 
liberty. There is no n eed for the common law to draw such a distinction and every reason for the 
common law to continue to protect those whom is has protected for centuries against unlawful imprisonment, whether by the state or private persons  [33] . 
 Accordingly, it is possible  for there to be imprisonment at common law without a deprivation of 
liberty under article 5 . It is not necessary to decide whether the converse  is true [34] .

On a proper reading of the NPPF  in its proper hist oric c ontext  visual quality of landscape is not in 
itself an essential part of openness for which the Green Belt is  protected [5]. While the text of 
paragr aph 90 of the NPPF has changed fro m that in Planning  Policy  Guidance 2 : Green Belts 
(publi shed 1995 , amended in 2001), there has been no significant change of approach [12]. The 
concept of “ openness ” in paragrap h 90 of  the NPPF is  a broad policy concept  which is the 
counterpart of urban sprawl  and is linked to the purposes to be served by the G reen Belt. Openness  is 
not necessarily a statement about the v isual qualities of the land, nor does it imply freedom from all 
forms of develo pment  [22]. The question is, therefore, whether visual impact  was a consideration 
which , as a matter of law  or policy , was necessary to b e taken into account, or w as so obviously  
material as to require  such  direct consideration [32] .  
 
Wheth er the proposed mineral extraction would prese rve the openness of the Green B elt or otherwise 
conflict with the purposes of including land within the Green B elt was speci fically identified and 
addressed in the officer’ s report. Paragraph 90 of the NPPF doe s not expressly  or impliedly mandate 
the consideration of visual impact as part of such an analysis  [39]. The officer’ s report does not 
suggest  that visual impact can never be relevant to openness [40]. The relevant paragraphs  of the 
officer’ s report  addre ssing openness must be read together. Some visual effect s were given weight  in 
the consideration of the restoration of the  site. The relati vely limited visual impact fell far short of 
being so obviously  material that failure to address it expressly was an er ror of law , as did the fact that 
the proposed development was an extension to the quarry. These were matters of planning judg ement 
and not law [41].

The Supreme Court unanimously  refuses to accept the Attorney General ’s application to refer this 
issue to the court under paragraph 34 of Schedule 10 to the 1998 Act. Lord Kerr, with whom Lady 
Hale and Lord Reed agree, gives the judgment.  
 REASONS FOR THE JUDG MENT  
 The Court notes that acts by the Secretary of State for No rthern Ireland or by departments in 
Westminster do not come within the purview of section 24 of the 1998 Act. For a devolution issue to arise, it must be shown that an act  or function has been  carried out by a Northern Ireland minister or 
department , and t hat the act in question is invalid by reason of s. 24  [6]. The prohibitions in s. 24 are 
disjunctive: it is forbidden to make, confirm or approve any subordinate legislation, or to do any act , so 
far as the legislation or act  is incompatible with the ECHR.  Acts ancillary to the enactment of 
subordinate legislation are thus in principle capable of being caught by s. 24.  It is therefore possible, on 
a theoretical or technical level, to consider that the Department’s provision  of the postcode lists in 
question amounts to such an ancillary act  [11]. 
There are , however,  two reasons that  the provision  of such lists cannot be said to raise a devolution 
issue. First, as the Court held in AGNI’s reference [2019] UKSC 1, where the Attorney General sought  
to refer to t his court a devolution issue that arose  in parallel pending proceedings, it wa s considered 
not to be appropriate to accept the reference. Th e same holds  true here: a challenge to the universal 
credit provisions will come before this court shortly on appeal  from a decision of the English Court of 
Appeal. It will be open to the Attorney General to apply to intervene in that appeal  [12].  
Second,  the fundamental underpinning of the Attorney General ’s case is that the introduction of 
universal credit in Norther n Ireland by act of the Secretary of State  is incompatible with the ECHR . It is 
not that the Department’s act  in identifying the areas where universal credit  is to be introduced that is  
incompatible. The publication of  the lists itself is not an act suffic ient to give rise to an incompatibility 
with t he ECHR.  For a devolution issue under Schedule 10  to arise, it must be shown that the 
departmental act under challenge is capable of being incompatible with the ECHR.  Because the 
publication of lists is not in itself capable of giving rise to an incompatibility, it is not a ppropriate to 
accept a reference under paragraph 34  [13 – 14] .

The Supreme Court unanimously allows the  appeal , giving judgment in favour of HMRC . Lord Briggs 
gives the main judgment.  Lady  Arden  agrees the appeal  should be allowed, but  for different reasons .

REASONS FOR THE JUDGMENT 
 
Article 221(4)  states that  HMRC m ay communicate a customs debt after the expiry of the three -year 
period in article 221(3) if the debt result s from an act which was liable to give rise to criminal court 
proceedings . Its purpose is to preserve the integrity of the criminal process whilst leaving the conditions 
(including time limits) for communication of a customs debt to each member state. Therefore, the 
disapplication of the three -year time limit is the automatic res ult of the likelihood of criminal court 
proceedings . It does not require  the selection by a member state of a different time limit [31]; [34]-[36]; 
[51]- [52]. 
 The next question is whether this would allow HMRC to issue demands without any time limit , and 
whether this would breach the fundamental principle of legal certainty in EU law [38] . The majority 
considers a number of options suggested by the parties, and by  the courts below, to mitigate the risk of 
late demands : 
 
(1) The domestic law doctrines of abuse of process and laches  do not assist because they concern 
the conduct of legal proceedings, not the communication of a customs debt  [39].  
 
(2) The Limitation Act 1980  cannot be invoked because t his would require the Court to disapply 
section 37(2)(a) of that Act (which provides that the Act does not apply to customs debts) on 
the basis that it was inconsistent with EU law. T here is no real inconsistency with EU law  because  
its requirement for legal certainty is adequately met by the reasonable -time principle at (3) below 
[40]-[44]; [ 46]. 
 
(3) There is a strand of EU jurisprudence to the effect that, where the provisions in force appear to 
allow legal action without any time  limit, then the principle of legal certainty require s it to be 
done within a reasonable time : e.g. Sanders v Commission [2004] ECR II -3315 [18]; [20]-[22]. The 
majority applies this approach and concludes that  HMRC was obliged to issue its post -clearance 
demands within a reasonable time  [45]. On the facts, HMRC did act within a reasonable time 
[48]. 
 
Since this analysis gives a clear answer to the question how article 221(4) applies  where there are no 
national provisions in force , it is unnecessary to make a reference to the Court of Justice of the European 
Union [47] . 
 Lady Arden adopts different reasoning for allowing the appeal.  She holds that the effect of EU  
jurisprudence concerning the old Customs Code is that EU law defers to national law and therefore does not require members states to enact a definite time limit [64] ; [67]. She expresses the view that domestic 
public law may impose a requirement for HMRC to act within a reasonable time which may be enforced by judicial review [66]  but rejects the majority’s reliance on EU decisions such as Sanders v Commission  on 
the basis that the old Customs Code leaves the question of time limits to individual member st ates. This 
may be one of the reasons why article 221(4) has now been revised [67] . Therefore, the communication 
of the post -clearance demand in the present case was not subject to a time limit  [68] -[69].
